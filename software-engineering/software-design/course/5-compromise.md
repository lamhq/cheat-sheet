# Compromise

## Design for Quality Attributes

When developing software, it is important to consider quality attributes in addition to functional requirements.

This involves trade-offs between different qualities such as performance, convenience, and security. 

Some common qualities to take into account in software design include: performance, maintainability, security, and backwards compatibility.

## Functional and Non-functional requirements

Qualities are achieved through satisfying functional and non-functional requirements.

Functional requirements describe what the system or application is expected to do while non-functional requirements specify how well the system performs.

Non-functional requirements might include performance, resource usage, and efficiency.


## Trade-offs

Balancing quality attributes is an ongoing process for software architecture, where architects must evaluate which attribute is more important.

Context provides important information when deciding on the balance of qualities in design.

Sometimes, choices made in software design have unintended consequences. 


## Compromise in Requirements and Design

- Compromises may be necessary in the design phase to create an acceptable solution.
- Communication and feedback between client and project team are essential to achieving a feasible design that meets client needs within any restrictions.
- Designs may need to be reworked if they prove impossible to achieve in the technical design or fail to meet requirements.
- Larger systems generally require more design time due to more components, connections, and responsibilities to keep track of.
- Technical diagrams become the basis for constructing the intended solution once a feasible design has been agreed upon.
- There are many design techniques that may be used to get the most out of the design process.

*Drawing on the architectural example used throughout this lesson, imagine the client would like an open kitchen in their house that has no obstructions between it and the dining room. But what if a post and beam is needed in that area to support the second floor of the house? The homeowner and the project will need to work out a compromise in that situation.*

In addition to balancing qualities and meeting functional requirements, it is important to consider multiple perspectives.

Software must satisfy qualities that matter to users as well as developers.

Balancing qualities must be understood and taken into account during design.

It is important to prioritize and understand what qualities are needed.

Constraints such as cost, time, and manpower also need to be considered.
