# Technical Design

Technical designs build on conceptual designs and requirements to define the technical details of a software solution.

It describes how technical designs break down components into smaller, more specific ones to be designed in detail, ensuring that each component has its technical details specified. 

Technical diagrams are used to communicate technical design, as they visualize how to address specific issues for each component. 

Technical diagrams help to coordinate development work and ensure that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of the technical details of the solution.

*To continue with the architectural example used throughout this lesson, imagine having to design a kitchen. A kitchen is a component of a house on its own, but it will require further smaller components, such as flooring. The technical design may indicate that the flooring will need to be made of a material that is easy to clean, particularly if the client plans on doing a lot of cookingâ€” cooking can be a messy business!*
