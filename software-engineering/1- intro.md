# Intro to Software Engineering

## Software Development is Complicated

Developing large software systems is a complex process due to:
- the large number of lines of code
- complexity from the application domain
- communication among stakeholders
- management challenges in dividing a project into pieces 
- coordinating with many different parts and people

The software complexity can lead to quality problems like unreliability, safety issues, inflexibility, and development problems such as over schedule, over budget, and not meeting user requirements.


## Dealing with the Complexity

To handle complexity in software development, the appropriate design goals must be chosen at the start of the project and prioritized.

Software quality characteristics:
- correct
- portable
- robust
- efficient
- productive
- timely
- evolvable
- reliable
- usable
- interoperable
- repairable
- verifiable
- maintainable
- reusable
- visible

Modularity and incremental development can also be applied, breaking the system into smaller pieces and using interfaces for modules. This leads to more productivity and fewer bugs in development.

Software engineers need training in both coding and software engineering, including communicating with stakeholders, using software development processes, and working as a team.

A software engineer needs to be able to:

- Talk with users in terms of the application.
- Translate vague requirements into precise specifications.
- Build models of a system at different levels of abstraction.
- Use and apply several software development processes.
- Choose among design alternatives (i.e., make design trade-offs).
- Work in well-defined roles as part of a team.

## What is Software Engineering

Software Engineering is the process of designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software systems.

It's a social activity that requires communication with customers, users, domain experts, and other engineers.

The focus of software engineers is on building quality software systems using best practices, while computer scientists focus on understanding algorithms and computing theory.

Software engineering involves more than just coding, it's also about project management, communication, and understanding the characteristics of technology.

The goal of software engineering is to avoid engineering failures and design the most appropriate technology into the software system.

Modeling activities include:

- requirements model: models the user requirements
â€“ solution model: models the system to be built

**Requirements model need to match solution model**
