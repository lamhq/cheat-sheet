# Scrum master

The scrum master ensures the scrum framework is followed. 

An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow.

The scrum master works with each member of the scrum team to guide and coach the team through the scrum framework.

They help the product owner define value, the development team deliver the value, and the scrum team to get to get better.

The scrum master serves the product owner to manage the backlog. In sprint planning and sprint reviews, ensuring that value is clearly being described and direction set. Help them plan the work with the team and break down that work

Serving the development team, the scrum master helps them self-organize, focus on outcomes, get to a “done increment” and ensure that blockers are being removed. 

The scrum master also serves the organization at large, helping them understand what scrum is and create an environment that supports scrum.
