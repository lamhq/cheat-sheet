# Scrum metrics

Scrum metrics are specific data points that scrum teams track and use to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Scrum teams use metrics to inform decision-making and become more efficient in planning and execution, as well as set target goals and improvement plans.

*"If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it"*


## Measuring Deliverables

### 1. Sprint Goal Success

A Sprint Goal answers three questions:

- Why are we carrying out the sprint?
- How do we reach the sprint goal?
- What metric tells us the goal has been met?

By defining sprint goals and then measuring how many sprints met the goal, you can get a qualitative assessment of a scrum team’s work. Not just how many story points are completed, but how frequently the objectives of the business are met.


### 2. Escaped Defects and Defect Density

Escaped defects is a crucial metric that shows how many bugs were experienced by users in production.


### 3. Team Velocity

Velocity measures how many user stories were completed by the team, on average, in previous sprints. It assists in estimating how much work the team is able to accomplish in future sprints.


### 4. Sprint Burndown

The sprint burndown chart shows the number of hours remaining to complete the stories planned for the current sprint, for each day during the sprint.

The sprint burndown shows, at a glance, whether the team is on schedule to complete the sprint scope or not.


## Measuring Effectiveness

### 1. Time to Market

Time to market is the time a project takes to start providing value to customers, or the time it takes to start generating revenue.

The first can be calculated by taking the length of the number of sprints before a scrum team releases to production.

The second could be longer, depending on the organization’s alpha and beta testing strategy.


### 2. ROI

Return on Investment (ROI) for a scrum project calculates the total revenue generated from a product vs. the cost of the sprints required to develop it.

Scrum has the potential to generate ROI much faster than traditional development methods, because working software can be delivered to customers very early on.


### 3. Customer Satisfaction

One metric is used to measure customer satisfaction is Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures if users would recommend the software to others, do nothing, or recommend against it.


## 4. Monitoring the Scrum Team

### 1. Daily Scrum and Sprint Retrospective

These two scrum events, if carried out regularly with well-documented conclusions, can provide an important qualitative measurement of team progress and process health.


### 2. Team Satisfaction

Surveying the scrum team periodically to see how satisfied they are with their work can provide warning signals about culture issues, team conflicts or process issues.


### 3. Team Member Turnover

Low turnover (replacement of team members) in a scrum team indicates a healthy environment, while high turnover could indicate the opposite.


## Which Metrics to Report to Stakeholders?

- **Sprint and release burndown**: Gives stakeholders a view of your progress at a glance.
- **Sprint velocity**: A historic review of how much value you have been delivering.
- **Scope change**: The number of stories added to the project during the release, which is often a cause of delays.
- **Team capacity**: How many developers are on the team full time? Has work capacity been affected by vacations or sick leave? Developers pulled off to side projects?
- **Escaped defects**: provides a picture of how your software is faring in production.
