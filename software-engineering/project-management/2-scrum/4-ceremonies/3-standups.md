# Stand-up

## Attendees

Development team, scrum master, product owner

## When

Once per day, typically in the morning.

## Duration

No more than 15 minutes.

## Purposes

Quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team.

Surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the teams ability to deliver the sprint goal.

Have each team member answer the following questions:

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What issues are blocking me?


## Tips

Choose a time that works for everyone: between 9 and 10 a.m

Keep stand-up efficient. Limit the duration of stand-ups to 15 mins–max.

Make the stand-up a part of the team’s retrospective. If the team isn’t finding value in a stand-up, discuss why. Make some changes!

For distributed teams, have every team member join a video stand-up on their own computer. Reference your scrum board while doing the meeting.
