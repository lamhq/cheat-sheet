# Sprint Reviews

## Attendees

- Primarily: development team, scrum master, product owner.
- Optional: stakeholders

## When

- Typically on the last day of the sprint, Friday afternoons.
- Before sprint retrospective.

## Duration

Typically two hours for a two-week sprint

## Purposes

The team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment.

Inspect the increment, get immediate feedback from project stakeholders.

Collaboratively update the product backlog.

Answer these questions:

- Did the team meet the sprint forecast?
- Was there work added or removed during the middle of the sprint?
- Did any work not get completed within the sprint? If so, why?


## Steps

### 1. Review the Sprint’s results

Reviews which items from the product backlog were completed during the previous Sprint and explains any that weren’t.

### 2. Discuss and demonstrate the work

The team (designers, developers, and the product owner) discusses their successes and pain points during the Sprint.

Then they hold a live demo of the finished software.

### 3. Update the status of the project

The PO discusses the current state of the product backlog and restates the scope of the project going forward.

### 4. Collaborate on the plan ahead

The team, stakeholders, PO, and any other meeting members work together to finalize next steps with respect to the insights gained throughout the meeting.

*For example, your PO may adjust the backlog or your team may impliment new processes for future Sprints.*

Its important to review all timelines, budgets, and other anticipated events that could affect the project.


## Tips

For teams that are new to sprint reviews, there’s a strong temptation to bleed sprint review into the retrospective.

A sprint review is an independent ceremony from a sprint retrospective. Effective sprint reviews build up the morale and motivation of the team.

A successful Sprint Review is not about a demo. Collaboration, not demonstration, should be your main focus in this meeting. Think of your Sprint Review is your team’s chance to regularly inspect and adapt the product the better.

If a sprint review doesn’t become a positive activity across the team, it may be indicative of:

- The team taking on too much work and not completing it during an iteration
- The team struggling with existing technical debt
- Features not being developed sustainably to ensure new bugs are not introduced into the codebase
- The team’s development practices aren’t as tuned as they could be
- The product owner is changing priorities within an iteration, and the development team is sidelined by scope creep
