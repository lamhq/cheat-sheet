# Sprint planning

## What are sprints?

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 

With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces


## What is a sprint goal?

When creating a sprint, the product owner usually identifies a sprint goal. This provides a theme for the work to be completed in the sprint.

A sprint goal also provides some flexibility in the number of stories that are completed in a sprint. 

A sprint is considered a success if the sprint goal is achieved.


## What is Agile Estimation?

Traditional software teams give estimates in a time format: days, weeks, months.

Many agile teams, however, have transitioned to story points. Story points rate the relative effort of work, often in a Fibonacci-like format: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.

## Sprint Planning Meeting

### Purposes

Answers two basic questions: 
- What work can get done?
- How will the chosen work get done?

### Attendees

Development team, scrum master, product owner.

### When

At the beginning of a sprint.

### Duration

Usually up to two hours per week of iteration.

### Steps

The product backlog should be prioritized, up-to-date and refined to provide clarity (in backlog grooming meeting).

Examine team availability: ask team members to confirm any planned vacation time, commitments to other projects, and other possible time restraints.

Ensure that all of your necessary resources are available.

The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal.

The team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog and break those items into smaller, actionable sprint items.

The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the **sprint backlog**.

By the end of sprint planning the team is ready to start work on the sprint backlog, taking items from the backlog, to “In-progress,” and “Done."


## Tips

Use the sprint planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.

Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the sprint.

User stories are one great way of describing the work from a customer point of view. By adding clear, measurable results to the user story, the outcomes can be clearly measured, and you know when you are done.

Don’t ignore the unknowns, they are the reality of doing difficult work. But don’t hide them by using vague words. Instead, be clear when you don’t know something and frame the work in terms of gaining an understanding.


### Do

- Ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order.
- Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured.
- Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
- Leave out work where you won't be able to get the dependencies done *(like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off)*.
- Once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool *(like your Jira tickets)*.
- Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity, and that it reflects things like leave and team meetings.


### Don't

- Don't pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can't be completed in the sprint.
- Don't forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health.
- Don't let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint.
- Don't take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.
- If you hear concerns from the team, whether it's about velocity, low-certainty work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, don't ignore it. Address the issue, and recalibrate when necessary.


### Optimize your sprints with automation

Here are three of the most common automation rules used for sprints in Jira:

- Send a weekly Slack message with all issues still open in the sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1363405)
- When a sprint finishes, then assign outstanding issues to the next sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1357182)
- When an issue moves to 'In Progress' and the sprint is empty, then move the issue to the next active sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1309924)
