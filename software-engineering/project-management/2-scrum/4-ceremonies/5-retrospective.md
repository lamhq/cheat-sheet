# Retrospective

## Why run a retrospective?

The agile manifesto makes it clear: In order to best live the agile values, teams should meet reguarly to check in and make adjustments.

## Sprint retrospective meeting

### Attendees

Development team, scrum master, product owner

### When

At the end of an iteration.

### Duration

Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration.

### Purposes

Find out what's working so the team can continue to focus on those areas.

Document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in:

- a sprint
- a project
- people or relationships
- tools
- even for certain ceremonies

Find creative solutions and develop an action plan for improving the way the team works.

### Steps

1. **Create a short list of things that worked well and things that could be improved.** This list can be created on a whiteboard, on an Atlassian Confluence page, or maybe even sticky notes on the wall!
    - What did we do well during the sprint?
    - What could we have done better?
    - What are we going to do better for next time?
    - What the team should start doing, stop doing, and continue doing?
    - What the team needs to do more and less of?
    - What made the team glad, sad, and mad. You guessed it, focus on the sad and mad lists and how to improve so there are only items in the glad column next time?
2. **Prioritize this list by importance as a team.**
3. **Discuss ways and tactics to improve the top two items on the "room for improvement" list**. Focus on outcomes, not actions or people, or the past.
3. **Create an action plan.** By the end of the session, the team should have produced a few actionable ideas with clear owners and due dates to address the areas of improvement. 
4. **Be disciplined about executing**. Each action item identified in the retro should have a clear owner who follows it through to completion.


## Tips

In order for retrospectives to be successful, there needs to be a supportive atmosphere that encourages (but doesn’t force) all team members to contribute.

The retrospective should be a positive, energizing experience for your team. It helps team members share important feedback, let go of frustrations, and work together to come up with solutions. 

A successful retrospective results in a list of improvements that team members take ownership of and work toward in the next sprint.
 
Even if things are going well across the team, don't stop doing retrospectives. Retrospectives provide ongoing guidance for the team to keep things going well.
