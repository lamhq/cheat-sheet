# Scrum

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together.

Often thought of as an agile project management framework, scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset.

You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

**Clear communication, transparency, and a dedication to continuous improvement should always remain at the center of whatever framework you choose.**


## Scrum, kanban, and agile

Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done.

Scrum is such a popular agile framework, like kanban, which is a popular alternative.

Both scrum and kanban use visual methods such as the scrum board or kanban board to track the progress of work.

Scrum focuses on smaller, fixed-length iterations. Once the time period for a sprint is finalized, the stories or product backlog entries that can be implemented during this sprint cycle are then determined.

In kanban, however, the number of tasks or the work in progress (WIP limit) to be implemented in the current cycle is fixed at first. The time taken to implement these features is then calculated backward.


## Why scrum?

The scrum framework itself is simple.

The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects.

Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
