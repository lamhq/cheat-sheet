# Extended artifacts

### Burndown chart

Burndown charts are graphs that display tasks completed over the duration of a sprint.

Burndown charts are very useful in helping to gauge the active execution velocity of a team so they know whether they will complete what is planned or need to reprioritize the sprint tasks.

Over time burndown charts help teams better refine their estimates during the planning stages of scrum.


### The definition of “done”

This definition can be another type of artifact, which should be documented and shared. 

*An example definition of done for a development team is when code is covered with automated tests that match a specification and is deployed to a production environment.*

Done also defines when tasks are complete and can be closed out for burndown tracking.
