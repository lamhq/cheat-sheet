## Scrum artifacts

Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project.

In scrum, these three artifacts are a **product backlog**, a **sprint backlog**, and an increment with your **definition of “done”**.
