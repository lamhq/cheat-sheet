# Product Backlog

## What is a product backlog?

A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements.

All work items should be included in the backlog: new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, action items from the retrospective, or work requirements needed to build a product.

A team's roadmap and requirements provide the foundation for the product backlog. Roadmap initiatives break down into several epics, and each epic will have several requirements and user stories.

It is maintained and curated by the product owner between sprint cycles and as any new ideas arise.

What may influence a product owner's prioritization?

- Customer priority
- Urgency of getting feedback
- Relative implementation difficulty
- Symbiotic relationships between work items (e.g. B is easier if we do A first)


## Keeping the backlog healthy

Product owners should review the backlog before each iteration planning meeting to ensure prioritization is correct and feedback from the last iteration has been incorporated. Regular review of the backlog is often called "backlog grooming" in agile circles (some use the term backlog refinement).

The product owner is free to re-prioritize work in the backlog at any time due to customer feedback, refining estimates, and new requirements. Once work is in progress, though, keep changes to a minimum as they disrupt the development team and affect focus, flow, and morale. 


## Anti-patterns to watch for

The product owner doesn't adjust the backlog as feedback rolls in from developers and stakeholders.
