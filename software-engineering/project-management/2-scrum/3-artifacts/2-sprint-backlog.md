### Sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is a set of product backlog tasks that are selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.

Sprint backlogs are created in the sprint planning meeting. The team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog and break those items into smaller, actionable sprint items..

A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, the fundamental **sprint goal** cannot be compromised.

*Consider an example task like “build a shopping cart page”, which requires many design and development subtasks. The product backlog is home to the primary task while the supporting tasks like “create a shopping cart visual design mockup” or “program the shopping cart sessions” are housed in the sprint backlog.*
