# Product increment (Sprint Goal)

A product increment is the customer deliverables that were produced by completing product backlog tasks during a sprint.

An increment is decided during the sprint planning phase. An increment happens whether the team decides to release to the customer.

Product increments are incredibly useful and complementary to CI/CD in version tracking and, if needed, version rollback.

*For example, some teams choose to release something to their customers at the end of every sprint. So their definition of "done" would be "shipped".*
