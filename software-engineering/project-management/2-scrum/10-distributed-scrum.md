# Remote scrum team

A distributed scrum team is just that -- a scrum team that is either fully or partially remote.

In order for a distributed scrum team to be successful, new approaches to adopting scrum need to be implemented.

## Challenges

Remote workers may have feelings of isolation, less team unity, and miss social interaction with work colleagues.

It also may be more challenging to develop a sense of camaraderie among work from home teams.

*At Atlassian, we make time for remote team meetings to not only be about work but also share personal stories and connect. We’ve even held games during virtual meetings to have some fun and get to know each other.*

Project knowledge can be scattered since it’s more challenging for remote teams to share information, especially when team members are in different time zones.

But numerous studies have found that remote teams are often more productive, with fewer distractions than at a physical workplace. 


## How to build a successful remote scrum team

A remote scrum team should follow the core scrum tenants of clear communication, transparency, and a dedication for continuous improvement. 

A remote team’s success depends on mutual trust, communication, and collaboration.

Effective collaboration tools are essential for all forms of remote working.

Impromptu chats: It’s important to allow for these **informal communication channels** to exist. 

Daily scrums: it’s important to schedule regular video conferencing. You can also hold asynchronous stand-ups where team members use Slack to check-in or comment on their work board to share updates.

Product backlog: It’s important that the features of the sprint backlog are clearly documented and “definition of ready” agreed upon.

When working remotely, it’s often best to have 5 - 6 people in a video conference.
