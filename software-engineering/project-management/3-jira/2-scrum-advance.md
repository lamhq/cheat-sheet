# Advanced scrum practices with Jira Software

## Step 12: Using epics in your backlog

*Epics are essentially large user stories that you can break down into smaller user stories. Epics can span more than one project.* 

*Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints. As a team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, some user stories will be added and removed to optimize the team's release time.*

*You can also create an epic when you notice a pattern among several user stories, and you want to bundle them into one group.*

If your team is working on user stories that build up a larger user story, which in turn affects multiple projects, go ahead and use epics — they can make project tracking easier in this scenario.

To use epics, head to the Backlog of your board, and expand the Epics panel by clicking **EPICS**.

### Linking a Confluence page to an epic

If you have linked your Jira Software site to **Confluence**, you can create and link Confluence pages to your epics. For example, you may want to link your epic to a specification or design document in Confluence.


## Step 13: Customizing your workflow

In Jira Software's default workflow, your issues move through three statuses: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

If this is too simple, you might consider creating your own workflow so that the statuses in Jira Software match your team's process.

You can add automation to your workflows.


## Step 14: Using the Velocity Chart

With the Velocity Chart, you can see a summary of the work that your team delivers in each and every sprint. You can use this information to predict the amount of work that your team can realistically complete in future sprints. 

During sprint planning meetings, for instance, your team can go through the visuals of what's happened in previous sprints — the team's commitment vs actual completion — and then come up with more realistic commitments.


## Step 15: Using Wallboards

Add gadgets to your Jira Software dashboard to show your team's progress in real-time.
