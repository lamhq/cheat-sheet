# Stories, epics, and initiatives

Your team want to do something ambitious, you’ll want to be able to respond to change, report your progress, and stick to a plan.

Epics, stories, and initiatives are precisely the tools you’ll need to do so.

What are stories, epics, and initiatives?
- **Stories**, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
- **Epics** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
- **Initiatives** are collections of epics that drive toward a common goal.

On an agile team, stories are something the team can commit to finish within a one- or two-week sprint.

Epics, in contrast, are few in number and take longer to complete. Teams often have two or three epics they work to complete each quarter.

Initiatives are made up of epics. An initiative compiles epics from multiple teams to achieve a much broader, bigger goal than any of the epics themselves. 

While an epic is something you might complete in a month or a quarter, initiatives are often completed in multiple quarters to a year.

*Let’s say your rocket ship company wants to decrease the cost per launch by 5% this year. That’s a great fit for an initiative, as no single epic could likely achieve that big of a goal. Within that initiative, there would be epics such as, “Decrease launch-phase fuel consumption by 1%,” “Increase launches per quarter from 3 to 4,” and “Turn all thermostats down from 71 to 69 degrees #Dadmode.”*


# Working with epics in company-managed projects

## Step 1: Create a new epic in Jira Software

There are three ways to create epics in Jira Software:

- Roadmap: enable **Roadmap** in **Board settings**
- Backlog
- Global Create issue button


## Step 2: Add stories or child-issues

Stories, bugs, and tasks describe a single piece of work, while epics are used to describe a group of issues that all relate to the same, larger body of work. 

Epics are typically completed over several sprints, or a longer time frame if you don't use sprints.


## Step 3: Viewing your epics

You can see information relating to all your epics in the Backlog.


## Step 4: Set up swimlanes for your epics on your board

During a sprint, you might find it useful to divide your board into swimlanes for each epic, to make the board visually clearer.

You can set this up in **Board settings** > **Swimlanes**.


## Step 5: Monitor the progress of your epic

In Jira Software, you can use the Epic Report to track the amount of work remaining over time so you can estimate when the epic will be completed.


## Step 6: Complete your epic

Click the status drop-down in the detail view of an epic and select **Mark as Done**.
