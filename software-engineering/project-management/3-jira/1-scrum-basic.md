# Learn scrum with Jira Software

Step-by-step instructions on how to drive a scrum project

## Step 1: Create a scrum project

Once you create, you can select a template from the library, select Scrum


## Step 2: Create user stories or tasks in the backlog

Create a few user stories.

Start prioritizing them in the backlog.

(You will continue to create stories for the project's lifetime.)

*User stories are used to describe work items in a non-technical language and from a user's perspective. . As a {type of user: who}, I want {goal: what} so that I {receive benefit: why}.*

*User stories are usually sketched out and prioritized by the product owner, and then the development team determines detailed tasks necessary to complete the story in an upcoming sprint.*

*The development team is also responsible for estimating the relative effort required to complete the work of the story.*


## Step 3: Create a sprint

Create your first sprint in the backlog so you can start planning the sprint.

*In Scrum, teams forecast to complete a set of user stories or other work items during a fixed time duration, known as a sprint.*


## Step 4: Hold the sprint planning meeting

In this meeting, the entire team discusses the sprint goal and the stories in the prioritized product backlog.

The development team creates detailed tasks and estimates for the high-priority stories.

The development team then commits to completing a certain number of stories in the sprint.

Add story point estimates to your stories (you can also add more details to the stories or create subtasks to further break down the work of the story.).

When you're ready, drag the stories agreed to in the sprint planning meeting into the sprint that you just created. This is your sprint backlog.


## Step 5: Start the sprint in Jira

Add a duration of the sprint and start and end dates, we recommend trying two weeks.

Add the sprint goal as agreed to in the sprint planning meeting.

Once you start your sprint, you will be taken to the Active sprints tab in the project.


## Step 6: Hold the daily standup meetings

After your sprint has started, have your team meet daily, typically in the morning, to review what everyone is working on.

The purpose of this is to see if anyone on your team is experiencing any roadblocks towards the completion of sprint tasks.


## Step 7: View the Burndown Chart

The Burndown Chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be done in a sprint.

Anti-patterns to watch for:

- The team finishes early sprint after sprint because they **aren't committing to enough work**.
- The team misses their forecast sprint after sprint because they're **committing to too much work**.
- The burndown line makes steep drops rather than a more gradual burndown because the **work hasn't been broken down into granular pieces**.
- The product owner **adds or changes the scope mid-sprint**.


## Step 8: View the sprint report

The Sprint Report includes the Burndown Chart, and lists the work completed, work not completed, and any work added after the sprint started.


## Step 9: Hold the sprint review meeting

The sprint review, or sprint demo, is a sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint.


## Step 10: Hold the sprint retrospective meeting

After you complete the sprint, have your team do a retrospective.

Document your retrospective somewhere (Confluence).


## Step 11: Complete the sprint in Jira

If the sprint has incomplete issues, you can move the issue(s) to the backlog.


## Step 12: Repeat from step 2

Add action items from the retrospective to backlog.

Add more issue: story, task, bug.
