## Insights

You can find the insights button on your **Board**, **Backlog**, and **Deployments** view, for easy reference while you plan or progress your work.

Insights are enabled using the **View aggregated data** permission.

Insights on the **backlog** provide support for you and your team during sprint planning sessions.

### Sprint commitment

The sprint commitment insight looks at the average story points, or issues, completed in the last five sprints to recommend a target range for future sprints.

Recommendations are automatically calculated if your commitment falls outside the target range, making it easy for you to adjust your scope as you plan. 

### Issue type breakdown

You can understand the balance of different work types. The insight only displays the issue types allocated to that specific sprint.

The callout lets you know which issue type appears the most in the sprint. This is useful during retrospectives, so you can reflect on recurring, time-consuming issue types. 

*Tips: Use the issue type breakdown for sprint planning sessions. Assess the balance of work in the current sprint. Then, adjust, maintain, or refocus your priorities during team sprint planning.*
