# What is agile project management?

Agile project management is an iterative **approach to managing software development projects** that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration.

Whatever agile framework you choose to support your software development, you'll need a way to see your team's progress so you can plan for future work or sprints:

- Agile project estimating helps both scrum and kanban teams understand their capacity.
- Agile reports show the team's progress over time.
- And backlog grooming helps project managers keep the list of work current and ready for the team to tackle.


## Waterfall versus agile

### Waterfall

Once a phase is completed, it can be difficult and costly to revisit a previous stage.

The waterfall project management approach follows a linear, sequential formula. It works well for work that has predictable, recurring processes.

A single missed deadline or scope change during a waterfall project can cause outsized impacts on subsequent releases.

When a team is fully focused on the next phase of work, resolving technical debt or fixing bugs can be painful if the team is fully allocated to new feature work and always pressing forward to the next stage.

The end customer can't interact with the product until it's fully complete.

### Agile

Agile project management takes an iterative approach to development by creating several incremental steps with regular feedback intervals. 

Iterative releases unlock multiple opportunities for a team to:

- adapt to changing circumstances from newly discovered requirements to a blocked piece of work.
- gather feedback from stakeholders during the process and iterate responsively without the stress of a final delivery deadline.
- build relationships and connections across roles that make it easier for people to connect and communicate effectively.

Agile principles:
- An agile project is segmented into several incremental steps that include regular feedback intervals.
- A project requirement is segmented into smaller pieces, which are then prioritized by importance.
- Promotes collaboration, especially with the customer. 
- Adjusts at regular intervals to ensure a customerâ€™s needs are met
Integrates planning with execution, which allows a team to effectively respond to changing requirements


Let's explore the mechanisms agile programs use to organize, run, and structure work in an iterative way.

## Roadmaps

A product roadmap outlines how a product or solution develops over time.

Roadmaps are composed of initiatives, which are large areas of functionality, and include timelines that communicate when a feature will be available.

As the work proceeds and teams learn more, it's accepted that the roadmap will change to reflect that new information.

## Requirements

Each initiative in the roadmap breaks down into a set of requirements. 

Agile requirements are lightweight descriptions of required functionality.

Agile requirements remain lean while everyone on the team develops a shared understanding via ongoing conversation and collaboration. 

Only when implementation is about to begin are they fleshed out with full details.


## Backlog

The team includes all work items in the backlog: new features, bugs, enhancements, technical or architectural tasks, etc.

The product owner prioritizes the work on the backlog for the engineering team.

The development team then uses the prioritized backlog as its single source of truth for what work needs to be done.
