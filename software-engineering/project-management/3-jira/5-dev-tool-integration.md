# Developer tool integrations

## Search Jira using JQL

Learn more about the [Jira Querying Language (JQL)](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql).


## Automate Jira via code changes

Instead of manually updating the status of an issue after creating branches or merging pull requests, you can [configure triggers in your workflow](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-workflow-triggers-776636696.html) to automatically transition issues when certain events occur in your development tools. 

Explore [Jira automation templates](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/bitbucket-github-gitlab) for Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitLab


## How to link code to Jira issues

When development tools are integrated with Jira Software, you simply add the Jira issue key in your development tool to link information. 

You can link Jira issues from your development tool by:

- Branch name: `PROD-1274-redesign-of-login-screen`
- Commit message: `PROD-1274 Fix eslint error and update tests`
- PR title: `PROD-1274 Redesign of login screen`
