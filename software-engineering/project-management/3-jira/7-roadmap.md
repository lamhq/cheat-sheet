# Roadmaps in Jira Software

Roadmaps in Jira Software are team-level roadmaps useful for planning large pieces of work several months in advance at the Epic level within a single project.

## Key Concepts

### Epics

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into individual tasks required to ship a feature. This work becomes a child issue of the epic

Epics are displayed as colored bars on the roadmap. 

### Child Issues

Child issues can be created directly from the roadmap and are nested within the epic they belong to.

The most common child issues are stories, tasks, and bugs.

### Start and due dates

The length of the bar on the roadmap correlates with the start and due date set for your epic. Setting dates for your epic helps to: 

- Communicate plans with the team and provide visibility to external stakeholders 
- Inform dependency mapping and help with resource management 

### Dependencies

Dependency management is critical for teams. When dependencies are visualized and well-mapped, a team can adapt and plan for alternative paths.
