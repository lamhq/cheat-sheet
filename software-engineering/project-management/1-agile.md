# Intro

## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative **approach** to project management and software development. 

It helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. 

Rather, agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.


## Why choose agile?

Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly. 

"Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.


## Agile yesterday, today, and tomorrow

Many agile frameworks have emerged such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP).

Scrum and XP are favored by software development teams, while Kanban is a darling among service-oriented teams like IT or human resources.

The agile teams of tomorrow will value their own effectiveness over adherence to doctrine.


## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a brief document built on 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development.
