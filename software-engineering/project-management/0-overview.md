# Overview

## Agile

Agile is an **approach** to project management and software development that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices. 

It is an **iterative** and **incremental** approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction¹. 

## Scrum

**Scrum** is a subset of Agile and is one of the most popular Agile frameworks. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one. Scrum is designed to help teams of three to nine members break their work into small, manageable chunks called **sprints**. Each sprint typically lasts two to four weeks and ends with a review meeting where the team demonstrates the work they have completed¹. 

## Scrum Roles

Scrum has three roles: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Development Team**.

The Product Owner is responsible for defining the product backlog, prioritizing it, and ensuring that the team understands it. 

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the team follows the Scrum process and removes any impediments that may be blocking progress.

The Development Team is responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of each sprint.

## Scrum ceremonies

Scrum has several ceremonies: 
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

Sprint Planning involves defining what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved.

Daily Scrum is a 15-minute meeting where team members share what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any impediments they are facing.

Sprint Review is a meeting where the team demonstrates the work they have completed during the sprint.

Sprint Retrospective is a meeting where the team reflects on their performance during the sprint and identifies ways to improve their process.

## When to use?

Scrum can be used in any project or organization that requires an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It has been used successfully in many industries including software development, healthcare, finance, education, and more.
