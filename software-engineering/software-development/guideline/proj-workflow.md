# Project Management

## Project setup

- Projects must be run by sprints that last for one or two weeks.
- Sprints must end on a day other than Friday and should end on Monday.
- List all components required for the project, such as: web, backend, mobile, design, ...


## Sprint planing

- The team must estimate tasks before the sprint starts.
- The unit for estimation is story points based on task complexity, not dev time.
- The team is committed to completing the sprint on time.
- Completion includes development, code review, and testing.
- Task assignment should not cause blocking.
- The total story point for each person should be balanced.


## Development

- Developers should **commit their work** to the repository every day.
- Developers must **log time** on the task they work on every day.
- Team lead must check that commits are regularly pushed by developers.


## Review

- A task when finishing development must be submitted to the team lead for review and testing through pull requests.
- Testing when reviewing is done by local test.
- A pull request is rejected if it does not pass review or testing.
- A task is done when the pull request is approved and merged.


## Finishing Sprint

- Final testing must be conducted two days before the sprint ends.
- Testing when finishing the sprint must be performed in a runtime environment (dev).


## After a Sprint

- It is important to track the velocity of each person and the whole team. This helps you understand how many points the team can finish in a period of time.
- You can then make a velocity report for that sprint which shows how much work was done by each person.
- Finally, you can export the tasks list for later reporting.
