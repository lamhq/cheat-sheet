# Coding Guidelines

# Refactor repeated code

When similar code is used **three times**, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

Exceptions:

- when the repeated code is very small in scope and fairly obvious in it usage.


## Adding new features

Focus on features that deliver value to users and be driven by the requirements.

Do not presume a feature. Only adding functionality until it is absolutely required.


## Delay your decision

Delaying committing to an option until not making a decision would remove an important alternative (last responsible moment)

It's not always about making the right decision every time, it's about making them the right way.


## Keep it simple stupid

Avoid unnecessary complexity and instead remain as simple and easy to understand as possible.
