# Documentation guidelines

## Handbook

Every project should have a handbook.

The handbook should include:
- Onboarding an engineer
- Development standard, principles and workflow
- Deployment workflow
- Support & monitoring workflow
- Architecture overview
- Tools and services
- Solution designs

The handbook can be built using Docusaurus and uploaded to a static web hosting service (Github Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Firebase)
