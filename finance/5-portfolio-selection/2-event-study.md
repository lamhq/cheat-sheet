# Event Study

## Definition

Event study is a powerful technique to assess the impact of an event on a firmâ€™s stock price.

## Abnormal return

Abnormal (unexpected) return is the difference between the actual return and what we might have expected.

Event studies estimate the abnormal return around the date that new information is released to the market and attribute the abnormal return to the new information.


## Measuring the abnormal return

We could write an index model, and decompose the return into a market and firm's specific component.

$$
r_t = a + b \times r_{mt} + e_t
$$

- $r_{mt}$: martket's return
- $b$: the sensitivity of the stock of the market return
- $e_t$: firm specific
