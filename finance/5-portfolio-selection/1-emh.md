## Efficient Market Hypothesis

## Definition
- Any information that could be used to predict stock performance should already be reflected in stock prices.
- New information, by definition, is unpredictable.
- Price changes should be random and unpredictable.
- Prices are seldom far above or below their fundamental values.

The notion that prices already reflect all available information is referred as the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** (EMH)

An efficient market is a market that efficiently processes information:
- Prices fully reflect all available information
- Price react quickly and correctly to new information
- There is "no free lunch". The only way you can get higher returns is by taking on more risk.

## Three versions of the EMH

The three-forms of market efficiency are distinguished from each other based on **how they define information**.

### Weak-form

Prices reflect all past **market trading information** such as past prices, trading volume or short interest

It implies:
- trend analysis is useless
- technical analysis has no merit


### Semi-strong form

Prices reflect all public information – in addition to past prices, all fundamental data on a firm’s product line, financial data, accounting data.

- most fundamental analysis is useless!
- The only way to reap benefits from fundamental analysis is if your analysis is better than any other competitor.


### Strong-form

Prices reflect all relevant information – public and even including information that is only available to insiders.

If the strong-form of the efficient market hypothesis is valid, then the weak-form also holds.

In an efficient market, all information is reflected to the prices. So, insiders cannot earn abnormal trading profits resulting from inside information. 


## Active vs. Passive Management

- There is no value to active management.
- Proponents of EMH advocate a passive investment strategy.
