# Effective annual interest rate (AER)

## Definition

An effective annual interest rate is the real return on a savings account or any interest-paying investment when **the effects of compounding over time are taken into account**. 

It also reflects the real percentage rate owed in interest on a loan, a credit card, or any other debt.

It is also called the effective interest rate, the effective rate, or the annual equivalent rate (AER).


## Nominal interest rate

The effective interest rate is different from the **nominal interest rate**, which is the rate stated on a loan or investment **without taking compounding into account**.

**For example**, if a loan has a nominal interest rate of 5% per year and is compounded monthly, the effective interest rate would be slightly higher than 5% because the interest is compounded multiple times per year.

The effective interest rate is important because it allows for a fair comparison of different loans or investments, even if they have different compounding frequencies. It is also used to calculate the total cost of a loan, including interest and fees, over the life of the loan.


## Formula

$$
AER = (1+\frac{i}{n})^n - 1
$$

- $i$: Nominal interest rate
- $n$: number of periods


## Examples

### Example 1

An annual interest rate quoted at $6\%$ compounded monthly means interest is paid at a rate of $6\%/12=0.5\%$ each month.

An annual interest rate quoted at $8\%$ compounded quarterly means interest is paid at a rate of $8\%/4=2\%$ every three months.

### Example 2

What is the effective annual rate on 1–year CD with a stated annual rate of $8\%$ compounded quarterly?

**Finding the effective rate involves first finding the rate per compounding period and then figuring out how many times the rate will get compounded over the period under consideration.**

$$
AER = (1+\frac{8\%}{4})^4 - 1 = 8.243\%
$$

### Example 3

What is the effective six-month rate if the stated annual rate is $8\%$ compounded quarterly?

$$
\text{6 Month Rate} = (1+\frac{8\%}{4})^2 - 1 = 4.04\%
$$

### Example 4

What is the effective six-month rate if the stated annual rate is $8\%$ compounded monthly? Round off your final answer to three digits after the decimal point. 

$$
\text{6 Month Rate} = (1+\frac{8\%}{12})^6 - 1 = 4.067\%
$$

### Example 5

What is the five-year effective rate if the stated annual rate is $6\%$ compounded semi- annually?

$$
\text{5 Year Rate} = (1+\frac{6\%}{2})^10 - 1 = 34.392\%
$$


### Example 6

Which one would you prefer as an investment return?

1. A stated annual rate of return of 6%, compounded monthly
2. A stated annual rate of return of 7%, compounded quarterly
3. A stated annual rate of return of 6.5%, compounded semi-annually
4. A three-month rate of 2%, compounded quarterly

In order to compare these alternatives, we need to find the effective annual rate.

1. EAR = $(1+ 6\%/12)^{12} − 1 = 6.167\%$
2. EAR = $(1+ 7\%/4)^4 − 1 = 7.185\%$
3. EAR = $(1+ 6.5\%/2)^2 − 1 = 6.605\%$
4. EAR = $(1+ 2\%)^4 − 1 = 8.24\%$ (highest)


### Example 7

Let's say you have $1000, after 3 years, it becomes $1400. What is the average annual interest rate?

The interest rate of 3 years period is: 

$$
r = \frac{1400 - 1000}{100} = 0.4
$$

The average annual interest rate is:

$$
(1+0.4)^{1/3} - 1 = 0.11868894208
$$

Let's check if it's the right value, by calculating the amount you have after 3 years with that interest rate:

$$
F_3 = 1000 \times (1+0.11868894208)^3 \approx 1400
$$
