# Calculating and Comparing Rates of Return

## Risk and return

When we think of investment, we should consider the **profit** (if everything goes well) and the risk of **losses** (if the investment is unsuccessfull).

The art of finance is about **making informed decisions** that consider both dimensions: risk and return, and optimizing the risk return combination of an investment portfolio.

## Calculating a Security's Rate of Return

To compare different investments, we need to calculate a percentage rate of return of each investment.

It is important to be consistent with the way we calculate returns.

Investments with different holding periods (timeframe) shouldn't be compared.

### Simple rate of return

Preferable when you have to deal with multiple assets over the same timeframe.

$$
\text{simple rate of return} = \frac{\text{ending price} - \text{beginning price}}{\text{beginning price}}
$$


### Logarithmic rate of return

Preferable when you make calculations about a single asset over time.

$$
\text{logarithmic rate of return} = \log{\frac{\text{ending price}}{\text{beginning price}}}
$$

### Converts to yearly returns

$$
\text{annual return} = [(\text{daily return} + 1)^{365}]*100
$$


## Calculating the Rate of Return of a Portfolio of Securities

Most investors own several stocks. The set of stocks that an investor owns is called an **investment portfolio**.

Every investor tries to select and add stocks that will optimize the overall rate of return of his portfolio.

The historical rate of return of a portfolio is the total of rate of return for a security * weight in portfolio.

It represents a large enough sample of the overall number of stocks in that market and can be considered a good enough proxy of the overall development of the market.

Practitioners use market indices to provide an idea of the overall market performance.
