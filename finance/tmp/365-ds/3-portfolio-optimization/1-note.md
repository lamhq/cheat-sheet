# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization

## Efficient Frontier

Investors shouldn't put all of their eggs in one basket. 

Investments in multiple securities shouldn't be analyzed separately, but should be considered in a portfolio.

Through the combination of securities with low correlation, investors can optimize their return without assuming additional risk. For any level of risk, there's alway a portfolio with the highest expected return.

The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for **a defined level of risk or the lowest risk** for a given level of expected return.

Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are inefficient portfolios. As for each, we can find an alternative portfolio with greater expected return for the same level of risk.
