# Risk aversion

## Preferences

We need preferences to describe choices.

Preferences tell us how individuals evaluate the trade-offs among difference choices.


## Utility Function

Utility is an index that describes preferences.

Utility = how you feel.

A utility function is a systematic way of assigning an index to rank choices.


## Risk Aversion

The degree of risk aversion measures just how much an investor prefers the sure outcome to an uncertain outcome.

The opposite of risk aversion is risk tolerance.

A very risk averse individual has a very steep utility function – or high marginal utility.

A very risk tolerant individual has a very flat utility function – or low marginal utility.

A risk-neutral investor considers only the expected return in judging a risky portfolio.

The concavity of the utility function measures the degree of risk aversion.

## How risk averse am i?

The amount i am willing to lose is 1% of my total assets


## What's Your Risk Aversion?

Most individuals have risk aversions between 1 and 10

There are variety of ways to measure risk aversion:

- **Questionnaires employed by financial planners**: These are surveys that ask individuals about their personal and financial preferences, experience, and goals. Based on their answers, a risk tolerance score is calculated, which indicates how much risk an individual is willing to take on.
- **Utility Theory**: This theory assigns a numerical value to each potential outcome based on an individual's perceived "utility" or satisfaction. By comparing the utility of different outcomes with varying levels of risk, it is possible to determine their relative preferences for taking on risk.
- **Behavioral Tests**: These tests use psychological experiments to observe how individuals behave when faced with risky situations. Observing how individuals act in real conditions can give researchers insight into their true risk aversion level.


## Expected utility

Expected utility combines probabilities of outcomes with how investors feel about these outcomes.

Maximize expected utility by choosing different:

- Spending/savings plans
- Asset holdings
- Production plans


## Indifference curves

Along an indifference curve, an investor is indifferent to all mean-volatility (or mean-variance) combinations.

One particular indifference curve represents a particular level of utility.

The more risk averse an investor, the steeper the slope of the indifference curve.


## Mean variance preferences

Portfolio choice problem = maximizing expected utility = finding the highest mean-variance indifference curve given the investment opportunity set and constraints.

Maximizing utility in mean-variance space graphically corresponds to choosing the highest indifference curve moving northwest

Under mean-variance preferences, utility is given by:

$$
U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2
$$

- $E(r)$: expected return
- $A$: coefficient of risk aversion.
- $\sigma^2$: variance

Limitation: An investor with mean-variance preferences cares only about means and variances, so she would not take into account the skewness and the kurtosis of the respective distributions. So she does not account for tail events.


## Risk Aversion Quiz

### Question 1

One way to measure investors' risk aversion is by comparing their certainty equivalent.

Economists define the certainty equivalent return $r_{CE}$ of a risky portfolio as **the sure return that an investor would be willing to accept instead of the risky portfolio**.

If you are more risk averse, what do you expect your $r_{CE}$  to be smaller or larger?

*Answer:*

If you are more risk averse, you would expect your $r_{CE}$ (certainty equivalent) to be smaller. A more risk averse investor would be willing to accept a lower risk-free rate of return instead of the risky outcome.

This is because more risk-averse investors require a greater level of compensation for taking on risk. Therefore, they would only be willing to accept a sure return that is smaller than the expected return of the risky portfolio. Conversely, less risk-averse investors might be willing to accept a lower level of compensation for taking on risk, implying that their certainty equivalent would be closer to the expected return of the risky portfolio.

In summary, the higher an investor's risk aversion, the lower their certainty equivalent return is likely to be, since they would require more compensation to accept a risky investment.

### Question 2

Which of the following statements are correct?

1. Most individuals have risk aversion levels between 1 and 10.
2. The concavity of the utility function measures the degree of risk aversion.
3. The level of risk aversion is different for each individual.

### Question 3

True or False: A fair game is a risky prospect that has a zero risk premium. It will not be undertaken by a risk-neutral investor.

*Answer:* False.

A risk-neutral investor does not require a positive risk premium. However, a fair game will not be undertaken by a risk-averse investor.


## Mean-variance preferences Quiz

### Question 1

Your financial advisor offers you a portfolio of **equities** with an expected return of 20% and standard deviation of 30%. Suppose at the time of this offer, **U.S. Treasuries** offer a safe return of 5%. Suppose your preferences can be described by mean-variance preferences, and you know your risk aversion parameter A to be equal to 2. Which would you prefer?

*Answer:* Equities

Let's compute the level of utility associated with each investment:

- Equities: U=20%-1⁄2×2×(18%)2 =11%
- Treasuries: U = 5%


### Question 2

Suppose you have two investment opportunities:  A gives you a future wealth of either $150,000 or $50,000 with equal probability. B gives you a future wealth of 125,000 with probability 2/3 and 55,000 with probability of 1/3. Suppose, also, that your preferences can be described by a log utility function. In other words, U(W)=ln(W). If you are maximizing your expected utility, which investment would you choose?

*Answer:* Investment B.

The expected utility associated with investment B is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
E[U(W)] &= 2/3 ×U(W1) +1/3 ×U(W2) \\
&= 2/3 × ln(125,000) +1/3 × ln(55,000) \\
&= 11.46
\end{align*}
$$

### Question 3

Consider the following three investment options:

| Investment | Expected Return | Standard deviation |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| A          | 20%             | 30%                |
| B          | 13%             | 15%                |
| C          | 23%             | 45%                |

Which investment would you choose if your preferences are represented by mean-variance utility and your risk aversion coefficient is equal to 3?

*Answer*:

The correct answer is investment B.
We compute the utility of each investment using mean-variance utility function:

- For investment A: $U_A = 0.2 - 0.5 \times 3 \times 0.3^2 = 0.07$
- For investment B: $U_A = 0.13 - 0.5 \times 3 \times 0.15^2 = 0.1$
- For investment C: $U_A = 0.23 - 0.5 \times 3 \times 0.45^2 = -0.07$

We would select investment B, since it provides us with the highest level of utility.
