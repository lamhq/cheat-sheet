# Events

## Introduction

Events are similar to moves, except that while a move changes `G` (game state), an event changes `ctx`.

Events are provided by the framework.


## Triggering an event

### From moves

```ts
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, ctx, events }) => {
    events.endPhase();
  };
}
```

### From client

```ts
import React from 'react';

function Board({ events }) {
  const onClick = () => {
    events.endTurn();
  };

  return <button onClick={onClick}>End Turn</button>;
}
```

### From hooks

The events API is available in game hooks like it is inside moves. Howerver, certain [events cannot be called from certain hooks](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/events?id=calling-events-from-hooks).


## Disabling events

```ts
const game = {
  events: {
    endGame: false,
    // ...
  },
};
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This doesn't apply to events in moves or hooks, but just the ability to call an event directly from a client.
