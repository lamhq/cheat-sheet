# Debugging

## Using the Debug Panel in production

The framework provides a debug panel that lets you interact with your game and game clients.

When you build your app for production (i.e. when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`) this is stripped out from the final bundle.


## Logging

To log data to Log section of the debug panel, use the `log` object in `move`'s arguments:

```ts
const move = ({ log }) => {
  log.setMetadata('metadata for this move');
};
```
