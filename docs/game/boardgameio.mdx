# boardgame.io

## Introduction

`boardgame.io` is an open‑source JavaScript framework designed specifically for building turn‑based multiplayer games.

It handles state management, networking, and synchronization so you can focus on writing the actual game rule.


## Features

- **State Management**: Game state is managed seamlessly across clients, server and storage.  
- **Multiplayer Support**: Game state is kept in sync in realtime and across platforms..  
- **Game Phases**: Lets you define different phases with unique rules and turn orders (e.g., betting phase vs. play phase).  
- **Lobby**: Player matchmaking and game creation.  
- **Prototyping**: Includes a simulation interface to test moves before building the UI.  
- **Extendable**: Plugin system that allows creating new abstractions.  
- **View-layer Agnostic**: Use the vanilla JS client or the bindings for React.  
- **Logs**: Game logs with the ability to time travel (viewing the board at an earlier state).  
- **AI Bots**: Automatically generated bots can play your game for testing or single‑player modes.  


## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="install boardgame.io" />


## State

Game state are defined in two objects: `G` and `ctx`.

```js
{
  // The game state (managed by you).
  G: {},

  // Read-only metadata (managed by the framework).
  ctx: {
    turn: 0,
    currentPlayer: '0',
    numPlayers: 2,
  }
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Because state can be sent between client and server,
`G` must be a JSON-serializable object; in particular, it must
not contain classes or functions.


## Moves

Moves are functions that changes the game state `G` when a particular game move is made.

They must not depend on external state or have any side-effects.

It's defined as part of the game configuration object:

```js
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, ctx }) => {
    const card = G.deck.pop();
    G.hand.push(card);
  },

  // ...
}
```

On the client, `moves` is provided through your component’s props:

```tsx
props.moves.drawCard();
```

## Events

Events are functions provided by the framework that allow you to manipulate the game flow, like ending the turn, changing the game phase etc.

Events are dispatched from the client in a similar way to `moves`:

```tsx
props.events.endTurn();
```


## Phase

A phase is a distinct stage in the game that overrides the game configuration while it is active.

For example, you can use a different set of moves or a different turn order during a phase.

The game can transition between different **phases**, and **turns** occur inside phases.


## Turn

A turn is a period of the game that is associated with an individual player. It typically consists of one or more moves made by that player before it passes on to another player.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also allow other players to play during your turn if needed.


## Stage

A stage is similar to a phase, except that it happens within a turn, and applies to individual players rather than the game as a whole.

A turn may be subdivided into many stages, each allowing a different set of moves and overriding other game configuration options while that stage is active.

Different players can be in different stages during a turn.
