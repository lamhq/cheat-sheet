# Jobs

## Setting an ID and name

Use `jobs.<job_id>` to give your job a unique identifier.

Use `jobs.<job_id>.name` to set a name for the job, which is displayed in the GitHub UI.

```yml
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
```

You can also set the default shell and working directory for:
- all jobs in the [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/set-default-values-for-jobs#setting-default-shell-and-working-directory)
- all steps in a specific [job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/set-default-values-for-jobs#setting-default-values-for-a-specific-job)


## Defining prerequisite jobs

Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run.

```yml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

You can also make a job [always](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-jobs#example-not-requiring-successful-dependent-jobs) run after other jobs have completed, regardless of whether they were successful.


## Using actions

In the workflow editor, you can search and browse actions from the sidebar.

You can add an action to your workflow by referencing the action in your workflow file. Actions can be in:
- The [same repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/find-and-customize-actions#adding-an-action-from-the-same-repository) as the workflow file
- Any [public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/find-and-customize-actions#adding-an-action-from-a-different-repository)
- A published [Docker container image](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/find-and-customize-actions#referencing-a-container-on-docker-hub) on Docker Hub

An action often accepts or requires inputs and generates outputs that you can use:
```yml
name: "Example"
description: "Receives file and generates output"
inputs:
  file-path: # id of input
    description: "Path to test script"
    required: true
    default: "test-file.js"
outputs:
  results-file: # id of output
    description: "Path to results file"
```


## Running scripts

You can run scripts and shell commands in steps using the `run` key:
```yml
    steps:
      - run: npm install -g bats
```

```yml
    steps:
      - shell: bash
        run: |
          value=`cat math-homework.txt`
          expr $value \* 9 > math-homework.txt
```


## Job Outputs

You can define outputs of a job and use them in another.

```yml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      output1: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.test }}
      output2: ${{ steps.step2.outputs.test }}
    steps:
      - id: step1
        run: echo "test=hello" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      - id: step2
        run: echo "test=world" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

```yml
jobs:
  # Assume job1 is defined as above
  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - env:
          OUTPUT1: ${{needs.job1.outputs.output1}}
          OUTPUT2: ${{needs.job1.outputs.output2}}
        run: echo "$OUTPUT1 $OUTPUT2"
```

## Running variations of jobs

Run job with different parameters defined in a matrix.

A matrix strategy lets you use variables to create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables.

```yml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

Matrices can be created dynamically using [contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#using-contexts-to-create-matrices) expression syntax.

You can use the [output](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#using-an-output-to-define-two-matrices) from one job to define matrices for multiple jobs.

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix.include` and `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix.exclude` to [expand](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#expanding-or-adding-matrix-configurations) or [exclude](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#excluding-matrix-configurations) matrix configurations.

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast` and `jobs.<job_id>.continue-on-error` to control how job [failures](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#handling-failures) are handled.

To set the maximum number of jobs that can run [simultaneously](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations#defining-the-maximum-number-of-concurrent-jobs) when using a matrix job strategy, use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.max-parallel`.
