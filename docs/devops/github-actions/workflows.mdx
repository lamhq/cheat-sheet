# Workflows

## Triggering a workflow

### Declaring Events

Use the `on` key to specify what [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) trigger your workflow:

- `push`: Triggered when code is pushed to a branch.
- `pull_request`: Runs when a pull request is opened, updated, or merged.
- `release`: Fires when a release is published or edited.
- `workflow_run`: allows you to execute a workflow based on execution or completion of another workflow
- `workflow_dispatch`: Allows manual triggering via the GitHub UI or API.
- `repository_dispatch`: Enables external systems to trigger workflows via API.

Using a single event:
```yaml
on: push
```

Using multiple events:
```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
```


### Using Event Activity Types

You can use activity types to further control when your workflow will run.

Syntax: `on.<event_name>.types`.

For example, if you specify the created activity type for the `label` event, your workflow will run when a label is `created` but not when a label is edited or deleted:

```yml
on:
  label:
    types:
      - created
```


### Using filters

Some events have filters that give you more control over when your workflow should run.

For example, the `push` event has a `branches` filter:
```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/**'
```

You can use filters to include/exclude specific [branches, tags, paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#using-filters-to-target-specific-branches-for-pull-request-events).


### Using conditionals

You can use conditionals to further control whether jobs or steps in your workflow will run.

Job level:
```yml
jobs:
  run_if_label_matches:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'bug'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo 'The label was bug'
```

Step level:
```yml
jobs:
  state_event_type:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: if is issue
      if: github.event.issue
      run: |
        echo An issue was closed
```


### Triggering from another workflow

Events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN` (except `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch`) will not create a new workflow run.

To [trigger a workflow from within a workflow run](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow), you can use a **GitHub App installation access token** or a **personal access token** to trigger events that require a token.

You can use [`workflow_run`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#using-filters-to-target-specific-branches-for-workflow-run-events) event to specify what branches the triggering workflow must run on in order to trigger your workflow. 


### Defining inputs for manually triggered workflows

When using the `workflow_dispatch` event, you can optionally specify [inputs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#defining-inputs-for-manually-triggered-workflows) that are passed to the workflow.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```


### Using environments to manually trigger jobs

If you want to manually trigger a specific job in a workflow, you can create an [environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#using-environments-to-manually-trigger-workflow-jobs) that requires approval from a specific team or user. Then, reference the environment name in a job in your workflow.


## Workflows and jobs concurrency

By default, workflows execute concurrently.

You can use the `concurrency` keyword to limit the number of concurrent workflow or job runs.

Workflow level:
```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

Job level:
```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: example-group
      cancel-in-progress: true
```

If `cancel-in-progress` is set to `true`, the workflow will cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group. You can use expressions in value of `cancel-in-progress`.

A [concurrency group](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/control-workflow-concurrency#using-concurrency-in-different-scenarios) can be any string or expression.

You can you a [fallback value](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/control-workflow-concurrency#example-using-a-fallback-value) in the group name if you have a property that is only defined for specific events.


## Choosing where to run jobs

You can use `jobs.<job_id>.runs-on` to define the type of [machine to run the job on](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/choose-the-runner-for-a-job).

You can also run jobs in a [container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/run-jobs-in-a-container).


## Reusable workflows

A reusable workflow is a workflow file that can be called by other workflows (even across repositories).

It helps you avoid duplication, centralize logic, and standardize CI/CD processes.

You can:
- Pass custom values from the caller workflow with `inputs`
- Securely pass sensitive data. with `secrets`

For example:

```yml title=".github/workflows/reusable.yml"
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      config-path:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      token:
        required: true

jobs:
  run-labeler:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/labeler@v5
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.token }}
          configuration-path: ${{ inputs.config-path }}
```

To invoke it:
```yml
jobs:
  use-reusable:
    uses: your-org/your-repo/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@main
    with:
      config-path: .github/labeler.yml
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Use cases:
- ✅ **CI/CD pipelines**: Centralize build, test, and deployment steps.
- 🔒 **Security checks**: Run scans and enforce policies before releases.
- 🧹 **Code quality**: Automate linting, formatting, and compliance.
- 📦 **Package publishing**: Push to registries like npm, PyPI, or Docker.
- 🏷️ **PR labeling & issue triage**: Auto-manage contributions.
- 🏢 **Org-wide governance**: Apply consistent rules across teams.
