# Workflows

## Reusable workflows

A reusable workflow in GitHub Actions is a workflow file that can be called by other workflows, even across repositories. It helps you avoid duplication, centralize logic, and standardize CI/CD processes.

You can:
- Pass custom values from the caller workflow with `inputs`
- Securely pass sensitive data. with `secrets`

For example:

```yml title=".github/workflows/reusable.yml"
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      config-path:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      token:
        required: true

jobs:
  run-labeler:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/labeler@v5
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.token }}
          configuration-path: ${{ inputs.config-path }}
```

Other workflows can invoke it using:
```yml
jobs:
  use-reusable:
    uses: your-org/your-repo/.github/workflows/reusable.yml@main
    with:
      config-path: .github/labeler.yml
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Use cases:
- ✅ **CI/CD pipelines**: Centralize build, test, and deployment steps.
- 🔒 **Security checks**: Run scans and enforce policies before releases.
- 🧹 **Code quality**: Automate linting, formatting, and compliance.
- 📦 **Package publishing**: Push to registries like npm, PyPI, or Docker.
- 🏷️ **PR labeling & issue triage**: Auto-manage contributions.
- 🏢 **Org-wide governance**: Apply consistent rules across teams.
