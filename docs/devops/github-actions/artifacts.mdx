# Workflow artifacts

## About

An artifact is a file or collection of files produced during a workflow run.

Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share that data with another job in the same workflow.


## Creating artifacts

```yml
name: Node CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: npm install, build, and test
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build --if-present
          npm test
      
      - name: Archive production artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist-without-markdown
          retention-days: 5
          path: |
            dist
            !dist/**/*.md
```


## Using artifacts

```yml
- name: Download a single artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: dist-without-markdown
```
