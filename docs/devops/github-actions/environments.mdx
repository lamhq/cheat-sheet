# Environments

## Overview

Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`

You can use environments to:
- require approval for a job to proceed
- restrict which branches can trigger a workflow
- gate deployments with custom deployment protection rules
- limit access to secrets

Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment.

Any protection rules configured for the environment must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner.

The job can access the environment's secrets only after the job is sent to a runner.


## Using an environment in a workflow

You need to create an [environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) before you can use it in a workflow.

The chosen job will now be subject to any rules configured for the specified environment.

You optionally can specify a deployment URL for the environment.

```yml
jobs:
  JOB-ID:
    environment: ENVIRONMENT-NAME
    url: URL
```
