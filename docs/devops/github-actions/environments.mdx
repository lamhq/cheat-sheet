# Environments

Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`

You can use environments to:
- require approval for a job to proceed
- restrict which branches can trigger a workflow
- gate deployments with custom deployment protection rules
- limit access to secrets

Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment.

Any protection rules configured for the environment must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner.

The job can access the environment's secrets only after the job is sent to a runner.
