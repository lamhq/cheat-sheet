# Variables

## About

Commands that run in actions or workflow steps can create, read, and modify variables.

You can set your own custom variables or use the default environment variables.


## Defining variables

You can set a custom variable in two ways:
1. Define an [environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-variables#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow) using the `env` key in the workflow file.
2. Define a [configuration variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows) at organization, repository, or environment level
