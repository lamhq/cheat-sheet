# Secrets

## Levels

Secrets allow you to store sensitive information in different levels:
- **Environments**: Secrets tied to deployment stages (e.g., `DEV`, `STAGING`, `PROD`). You can enable reviewers to approve a job to access a secret
- **Repository**: Secrets used only within a single repo. 
- **Organization**: share secrets between multiple repositories, you can configure repositories that can access a secret


## Redacting

GitHub Actions automatically redacts GitHub secrets and information that is recognized as sensitive in the workflow logs.


## GITHUB_TOKEN

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is a secret that is automatically created at the start of each workflow job.

The token can be used to authenticate on behalf of the GitHub App installed on your repository.

It when a job finishes or after a maximum of 24 hours.

The token is also available in the `github.token` context.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` with workflow triggers:
- Events triggered by the job that use `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not create a new workflow run (except for `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch`).
- Commits pushed by a GitHub Actions workflow that uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger a GitHub Pages build.
