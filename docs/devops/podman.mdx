# Podman

## Why Podman?

1. Podman is completely free and open source
2. Improve security because it doesn't require root privileges for running containers (Rootless Mode)
3. Lightweight: Podman doesn't rely on a central daemon, uses fewer resources
4. Compatible with Docker CLI
5. Directly generates YAML for Kubernetes deployment.


## Installation (macOS)

1. For a graphical interface, you can install [Podman Desktop](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
2. For the CLI, it is **recommended** to download the [installer](https://podman.io/docs/installation#macos)

After installing, init the Podman machine:
```sh
podman machine init
```

Then start it:
```sh
podman machine start
```

To stop it:
```sh
podman machine stop
```


## Rootless mode

Rootless mode allows regular users to deploy containers without elevated privileges (without becoming **root** or using `sudo`).

Improved security: rootless containers cannot access and manipulate resources that require **root** privileges.

When not to use rootless containers:

- You need the container to have write access to the host's file system
- You need to bind the container to a port lower than 1024, without reconfiguring `sysctl`

To enable rootless mode:

```sh
podman machine set --rootful=false
```

To disable rootless mode:

```sh
podman machine set --rootful
```
