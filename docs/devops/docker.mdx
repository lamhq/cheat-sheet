# Docker

## Overview

Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, run, update, and manage applications in containers.

Docker makes it easy to create, package, deploy, and run containers.

It includes various tools and components like Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Compose, and Docker Desktop.


## Docker Engine

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for creating and running Docker containers.

It comprise:
- Docker daemon: a server that performs container management `dockerd`
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client `docker`.

Docker Engine is the core part of the Docker platform.


### Install Docker Engine

To install Docker Engine on macOS, you install Docker Desktop, which includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose.

Docker Desktop is not free for businesses, so it's important to consider this when deciding whether to use it into your company's workload.

An alternative is Podman, open-source container engine. Podman is compatible with Docker's CLI, most Docker commands will work seamlessly with Podman.
