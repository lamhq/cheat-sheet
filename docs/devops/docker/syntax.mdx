# Dockerfile

## Overview

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile, you can automate the image creation process. 

A Dockerfile typically consists of a series of instructions. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image. 

Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a Python application:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```


## Syntax References

### FROM
- Specifies the base image to use.
- Example: `FROM ubuntu:latest`

### RUN
- Executes a command in the image.
- Example: `RUN apt-get update -y`

### WORKDIR
- Sets the working directory for subsequent commands.
- Example: `WORKDIR /app`

### COPY
- Copies files or directories from the host machine to the image.
- Example: `COPY my_script.py .`

### EXPOSE
- Informs Docker that the container listens on a specific port.
- Example: `EXPOSE 8080`

### CMD
- Sets the default command to be run when the container starts.
- Example: `CMD ["python", "my_script.py"]`

### ENTRYPOINT
- Sets the executable file to run when the container starts.
- Example: `ENTRYPOINT ["python"]`


## Multi-Stage build

Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction starts a new stage of the build process, and you can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another. 

This helps in keeping the final image lean by excluding unnecessary build dependencies.

Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a Go application:
```dockerfile
# First stage: Build the application
FROM golang:1.23 AS builder
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN go build -o /app/hello

# Second stage: Create the final image
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/hello /app/hello
CMD ["/app/hello"]
```
- The first stage (`builder`) uses the `golang` image to compile a Go application.
- The second stage (`scratch`) creates a minimal final image that only contains the compiled binary.
