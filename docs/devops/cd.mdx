# Continuous Delivery

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development approach where software is automatically built, tested, and prepared for release. It ensures every change is always in a deployable state.

Continuous delivery treats each check-in as a release candidate, assessing its quality before deployment. 

Human still decides when to deploy software to production.


## Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates (without human intervention).

Continuous deployment is an extension of continuous delivery.


## CD Tools

Features that a CD tool should have:

1. **Pipeline Definition & Visualization** – A CD tool enables users to define and visualize the pipeline from development to production.

2. **Automated Verification Stages** – The tool facilitates automated testing and validation at different pipeline stages. If code successfully passes a verification step, it automatically advances.

3. **Support for Manual Stages** – Some steps require human intervention, like user acceptance testing (UAT). A CD tool should allow modeling these manual processes within the pipeline.

4. **Build Management & Deployment** – The tool helps track available builds, ensuring readiness for deployment. Users can deploy builds to specific environments.

5. **Status Marking & Progression Control** – After manual checks, users can mark a stage as successful, allowing the build to proceed to the next step.

6. **Automatic Triggering of Subsequent Stages** – If the next phase is automated, the CD tool ensures that once conditions are met, the process moves forward without manual intervention.


## Artifact

An artifact is a deployable package of software created during CI/CD process. It is tested, verified, and stored for deployment in different environments.

Key characteristics:

1. **Deployable** – The artifact contains everything needed for deployment, like compiled code, dependencies, or container images.
2. **Technology-dependent** – The type of artifact varies based on the deployment technology (e.g., a JAR file for Java apps, a Docker image for containerized apps).
3. **Stored in repositories** – After creation, artifacts are saved in storage solutions like **Artifactory, Nexus, or container registries** for later retrieval.

> [!TIP]
> 1. Build the artifact once, early in the pipeline
> 2. Reuse the artifact everywhere you want to deploy
> 3. Environment-specific configuration need to be kept outside
the artifact
