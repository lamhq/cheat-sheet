# Continuous Integration

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, usually multiple times a day.

Each integration is automatically verified by building the software and running automated tests to ensures seamless collaboration.

The main goals of CI include:
- **Detecting bugs early** – Small, frequent updates help identify issues before they escalate.
- **Improving collaboration** – Developers work on the same codebase and integrate changes seamlessly.
- **Accelerating development** – Automated testing ensures rapid feedback and a smoother development process.
- **Reducing integration problems** – Since code is merged often, there are fewer conflicts compared to infrequent, large-scale integrations.


## Artifact

CI generates artifacts for further validation, such as deploying a running service for testing.

Artifacts should be built once and reused (to maintain consistency and efficiency) by stored in a repository, either within the CI tool or an external system.

### Benefits

- **Fast Feedback:** get fast feedback about code quality via static analysis and testing.  
- **Automatic creation:** Binary artifacts are automatically created, with version-controlled build processes ensuring reproducibility.  
- **Traceability:** Deployed artifacts can be traced back to source code, along with details of tests conducted.  
- **Enhances transparency and simplifies builds** if using infrastructure as code, we can version control both microservice and infrastructure configurations, ensuring transparency and easier build reproduction.


## Are You Really Doing CI?

Merely using a CI tool (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis) doesn’t guarantee true CI adoption.

Three key questions to test if they you're really doing CI?

1. **Do you check in to mainline once per day?** Frequent integration prevents future complexities, even when using short-lived branches.  
2. **Do you have a suite of tests to validate your changes?** – Without tests, we don’t know if we have broken the behavior of the system
3. **When the build is broken, is it the #1 priority of the team to fix it?** – You must resolve the build issue before moving on to other tasks.


## CI Tips

- **Integrate early and often** to minimize merge conflicts.  
- **Favor trunk-based development, short-lived branches** to streamline collaboration.  
- **Commit sooner**, fast patch merges in open source projects help developers move quickly.  
- **Work in small batches**, large changes are harder to review and merge.  
- **Use automated testing** to boost productivity.
