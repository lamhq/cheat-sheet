# Secrets

## Overview

A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data, such as a password, OAuth token, SSH key, certificates, etc.

Kubernetes only makes secrets available to nodes that have Pods requesting the secret.

Secrets are stored in tmpfs on a Node (not on disk).


## Creating a Secret

```sh
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key1=value1 --from-literal=key2=value2
```

From a file:
```sh
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=ssh-privkey=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

> [!CAUTION]
> You can define Secrets in YAML (just like Deployments, Services, etc.) but they are only base64-encoded, not encrypted. Therefore, avoid committing it to Git.


## Using a Secret

### In Command Line

Get all secrets:
```sh
kubectl get secrets
```

Get a secret by name:
```sh
kubectl get secret my-secret -o yaml
```


### In Pods

Secrets can be mounted into pods as files or environment variables.

Through environment variables:

```yml
env:
- name: MY_SECRET
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: key1
```

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  key1: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
  key2: dmVyeV9zZWNyZXQ=
```

Through a volume:
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: busybox
        command: ["sleep", "3600"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          mountPath: "/etc/secret-data"
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: secret-volume
        secret:
          secretName: my-secret
```
- Each key is converted to a file
