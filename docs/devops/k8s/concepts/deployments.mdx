# Deployments

## Overview

A Deployment is a higher-level Kubernetes object that wraps around a Pod and adds features such as self-healing, scaling, zero-downtime rollouts, and versioned rollbacks.

> [!INFO]
> You can deploy containers by define them in a Pod template. However, static Pods don't self-heal, they don't scale, and they don't allow for easy updates and rollbacks.


## Deployments and ReplicaSets

Deployments rely heavily on another object called a ReplicaSet.

A ReplicaSet is a declarative way to manage Pods. A Deployment is a declarative way to manage Pods using a ReplicaSet.

ReplicaSets manage Pods and bring self-healing and scaling. Deployments manage ReplicaSets and add rollouts and rollbacks.

It's not recommended to manage ReplicaSets directly, but let the Deployment controller manage them.


## Deployment spec

A Deployment object is a high-level Kubernetes resource that describes the desired state of a stateless app.

It is defined in YAML or JSON file, called the Deployment spec:

```yml {6,8,10}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.23
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

- `replicas`: specifies the number of desired Pod replicas to run.
- `matchLabels`: Defines how the Deployment identifies the Pods it manages. In this case, it uses the label `app: my-app`
- `template`: Pod template, describes how the Pods should be created


## Deployment controller

The controller element reconciling observed state with desired state defined in the Deployment spec.

> [!NOTE]
> Reconciliation refers to the process where the controller ensures that the actual state of a resource matches its desired state as defined in the resource's specification.

Responsibilities:

- **Pod Scaling**: It creates, updates, or deletes Pods to match the desired `replicas` count.
- **Rolling Updates**: It gradually replaces old Pods with new ones during an update to minimize downtime.
- **Rollback**: If an update causes issues, the Deployment controller can revert to a previously stable state.
- **Self-Healing**: If Pods go into a failed state or are unintentionally deleted, the Deployment controller recreates them to ensure consistency with the desired state.
- **History Tracking**: It maintains a revision history of updates, allowing you to inspect and roll back to previous versions of the Deployment configuration if needed.


## Deployments and Pods

A Deployment object only manages a single Pod template.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, an application with a front-end web service and a shopping basket service will have a different Pod template for each. As a result, it'll need two Deployment objects, one managing frontend web Pods, the other managing any shopping basket Pods.


## Rolling update

Setting related to rollout update:

```yml
revisionHistoryLimit: 5
progressDeadlineSeconds: 300
minReadySeconds: 10
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1
```
- `revisionHistoryLimit`: keep the configs of the previous 5 releases
- `progressDeadlineSeconds`: the maximum seconds to wait for the Deployment to progress to its desired state (e.g., completing a rolling update) before marking it as failed.
- `minReadySeconds`: the minimum secondss a newly created Pod must be in the Ready state before it's considered available.
- `maxUnavailable`: the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during a rolling update
- `maxSurge`: the maximum number of extra Pods that can be created above the desired number of replicas during a rolling update

> [!NOTE]
> As the desired state of the app requests 10 replicas, `maxSurge: 1` means you'll never have more than 11 replicas during the update process, and `maxUnavailable: 1` means you'll never have less than 9. The net result is a rollout that updates two Pods at a time
(the delta between 9 and 11 is 2).


## Rollback

Kubernetes maintains a documented revision history of rollouts.

Rolling updates create new ReplicaSets, but old ReplicaSets aren't
deleted, makes them ideal for executing rollbacks.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the command `kubectl get rs` to list all ReplicaSets

Rollbacks follow the same rules as rolling update (defined in the `strategy` block of the Deployment object).
