# Services

## Overview

A Service provides a single point of entry for accessing one or more Pods. It maintains a list of healthy Pods and load-balance traffic to them.

Services rely on **labels** and **selectors** to associate with Pods. For a Service to send traffic to a Pod, all labels of that Pod needs to match with the ones Service is selecting (Boolean AND).

```yml {9,10}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-svc
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-world   <<==== Send to Pods with these labels
    env: tkb           <<==== Send to Pods with these labels
```

Services are not ephemeral.

Every Service gets its own: IP address, DNS name, port. All are never changed.

Services cannot provide application-layer host and path routing. 


## Service spec

Basic structure of a Service spec:

```yml {3,6,8,10}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  type:

  selector:

  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

- `name`: name of the Service
- `metadata`: Metadata about the Service
- `type`: type of service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- `selector`: labels of the Pods to send traffic to
- `ports`: define container target port and the port for the service

> [!TIP]
> Pods inside the cluster can access the service using the address `<service_name>:<port>`. In the example above, the address would be `frontend:8080`.


## Service types

There're 4 types of Services:
- ClusterIP: Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster (default).
- NodePort: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port.
- LoadBalancer: Provision an external IP to acts as a load balancer for the service
- ExternalName: Maps the Service to an external DNS name.


### ClusterIP

- Exposes an IP address internally within the cluster
- Only pods within the cluster can talk to the service
- External world cannot directly access ClusterIP services
- ClusterIP enable pods to communicate with other pods (common for internal microservice communication)

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service-1
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: nginx1-pod
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

### NodePort

- Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port.
- Automatically allocates a port by default (typically in range 30000-32767)

How it work?
- Each node in the cluster listens on the same NodePort.
- External caller connects to service using address: `<Node-IP>:<NodePort>`.
- Traffic is proxied through the service to pods.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-nginx-pod
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 31000
```
- `targetPort: 80`: The **port on the pod** where the container is actually listening. The service forwards traffic here.
- `port: 8080`: The port that the service exposes **inside the cluster**. Other pods will use this to reach the service (using address: `nginx-nodeport:8080`).
- `nodePort: 31000`: A static port that’s opened **on every node** in the cluster. External clients can send traffic to any node’s IP on this port, and it gets routed to the service.

> [!TIP]
> You can get node's IP using the command `kubectl get nodes -o wide`


### LoadBalancer

Exposes the service externally to the outside world.

When you create a LoadBalancer Service, Kubernetes provisions a cloud provider's load balancer to route external traffic to your Pods.

How it work?
1. External traffic begins from a client accessing the public IP of the LoadBalancer service.
2. The LoadBalancer routes traffic to one of the cluster nodes with the NodePort service automatically set up on each node.
3. The NodePort service forward traffic to an internal ClusterIP service
4. ClusterIP service matches the request to backend pods based on labels.

The following YAML defines a new Service called `nginx-loadbalancer` that will provision a load-balancer listening on port `9000` and forward traffic on port `8080` to all Pods with the label `chapter` equal to `services`:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    chapter: services
  ports:
  - port: 9000
    targetPort: 8080
```

> [!TIP]
> You can access the load balancer using its public IP address (the `EXTERNAL-IP` field from the `kubectl get svc --watch` command) with the port defined in the YML file.


### ExternalName

Service that acts as an alias for an external service:
- Does not route traffic to pods like other service types.
- Creates a DNS alias (CNAME record) inside the cluster.
- Points to an external domain name instead of internal endpoints.

How It Works?
- You define a service with `type: ExternalName`.
- Kubernetes updates its internal DNS to map the service name to the external domain.
- When a pod queries the service name, it gets redirected at the **DNS level**, not through a proxy.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-db
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: db.example.com
```

Use Cases:
- Use the same service name (`db`) across dev, staging, and prod, but point to different external databases.
- Connect to managed services like AWS RDS or Redis without hardcoding URLs.
- Switch providers by updating the ExternalName field—no app code changes needed.

Limitations:

- **No port definitions**: You can’t specify ports in ExternalName services.
- **No health checks**: Kubernetes won’t verify if the external service is up.
- **No IP targets**: You must use a domain name, not an IP address.
- **TLS caveats**: HTTPS may fail if the certificate doesn't match the service name (e.g., `curl` might complain about mismatched hostnames).
- **No load balancing**: Even if the external domain resolves to multiple IPs, Kubernetes won’t balance traffic.
