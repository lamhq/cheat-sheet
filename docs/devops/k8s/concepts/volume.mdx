# Volume

## Overview

A volume can be used to hold data and state for Pods and containers.

A Pod can have multiple Volumes attached to it.

A Volume references a storage location, each must have a unique name.

A Volume Mount references a Volume and mounts it to a specific path in the container.


## Volume types

- **emptyDir**: empty directory that exists as long as the Pod is running. Useful for sharing files between containers in a Pod.
- **hostPath**: mounts a directory from the host node's filesystem into the container. Not recommended for production use.
- **nfs**: An NFS (Network File System) share mounted into the Pod.
- **configMap/secret**: Mounts a ConfigMap or Secret as a file or directory.
- **persistentVolumeClaim**: Mounts a Persistent Volume (PV) into the Pod.
- **Cloud**: mount a cloud storage from Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)


### emptyDir

```yaml title="emptydir.pod.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: emptydir-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  - name: updater
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args:
    - |
      while true; do
        echo "<html><body><h1>$(date)</h1></body></html>" > /html/index.html;
        sleep 5;
      done
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-html
      mountPath: /html
  volumes:
  - name: shared-html
    emptyDir: {}
```

- The `emptyDir` volume is shared between both containers.
- Alpine writes `index.html` with the current date every 5 seconds.
- nginx automatically serves the updated file from the shared volume.


### hostPath

A web server that serves files from the host's `/html` directory:

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-hostpath-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      readOnly: true
  
  volumes:
  - name: host-html
    hostPath:
      path: /html
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
```


## Persistent Volume

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a cluster-wide storage unit provisioned by an administrator with a lifecycle independent from a Pod. 
- Available to a Pod even if it gets rescheduled to a different node.
- Associated with a Pod using a PersistentVolumeClaim. 

A Persistent VolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for a storage unit (PV).

### Defining a PersistentVolume

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: aws-ebs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: vol-0abcd1234efgh5678
    fsType: ext4
```
- `volumeID`: EBS volume ID
- `ReadWriteOnce`: Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
- `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain`: Volume is not deleted when the PVC is deleted.


### Defining a Persistent VolumeClaim

```yml {4}
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```


### Using a PersistentVolumeClaim

```yml {11,13,15}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
          name: my-storage
  volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```


## StorageClass

A StorageClass (SC) is a type of storage template that can be used to dynamically provision storage.

- Used to define different classes of storage
- Act as a type of storage template
- Support dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes

How it work?

1. Administrators don't have to create PVs in advance
2. PVC can reference StorageClass
3. Kubernetes uses StorageClass to provision a PV
4. The created PV is then bound to the PVC.


Define a local storage StorageClass:
```yml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: local-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
reclaimPolicy: Retain
```
- `kubernetes.io/no-provisioner` tells Kubernetes not to dynamically provision volumesâ€”because you're managing them manually.
- `WaitForFirstConsumer` ensures the volume is only bound when a pod is scheduled, which helps with node affinity.

To make this work, we also need to manually define a PersistentVolume that matches this StorageClass:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: local-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Block
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /data/storage
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
              operator: In
              values:
                - your-node-name
```
- `local.path`: Path to the local disk on the node.
- `nodeAffinity`: Ensures the volume is only used on the specified node (`your-node-name` should match the actual node hostname).
- `storageClassName`: Must match the StorageClass you created (`local-storage`).
- `accessModes`: `ReadWriteOnce` means one node can write to it at a time.

Define a PVC that uses the StorageClass:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: local-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: local-storage
```


## Viewing a Pod's Volume

```sh
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
```
