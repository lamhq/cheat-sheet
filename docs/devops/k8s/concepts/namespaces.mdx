# Namespaces

## Overview

Namespaces are a way to divide a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters.

It is useful for managing different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) or providing multi-tenancy.

Most Kubernetes objects (Pods, Services, Deployments, ...) are deployed to a Namespace.

The **default** Namespace is used if you don't specify the target namespace.

Each namespace has its own set of users, permissions, and unique resource quotas.


## Limitations

Namespaces are not designed for strong workload isolation.

**Not a Security Boundary**: Namespaces are not designed to provide strong security isolation (for example, they don't prevent access to resources in other namespaces).

> [!TIP]
> If you need strong workload isolation, the current method is to use multiple clusters.

**Shared Cluster Resources**: Namespaces share the same underlying cluster resources, such as nodes and the control plane. This means that resource contention or misconfigurations in one namespace can potentially affect others

**Limited Scope**: Namespace isolation applies only to namespaced objects (e.g., Pods, Services). Cluster-wide resources like Nodes, PersistentVolumes, and StorageClasses are not isolated by namespaces
