# Pods

## Overview

The process of building and running an app on Kubernetes:
1. Write your app/code
2. Package it as a container image
3. Wrap the container image in a Pod
4. Run it on Kubernetes

A Pod is a group of one or more containers that run your application.

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage.


## Scheduling

A Pod can only be scheduled to a single node.

Every container in a Pod is guaranteed to be scheduled to the
same node.


## Networking

Every Pod has its own:
- IP address
- range of TCP and UDP ports
- routing table

If it's a multi-container Pod:
- all containers share the IP.
- containers communicate with each other via the Pod's `localhost` adapter and a port number.

Pod's name will become the hostname of containers run inside it. It must be valid [DNS names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names).

## Pod lifecycle

A Pod after created enter the **pending** phase.

Once all containers are pulled and running, the Pod enters the **running** phase.

If it's a short-lived Pod, as soon as all containers
terminate successfully, the Pod enters the **succeeded** state.

### Restart policy

If a long-lived Pod fail, the local kubelet may attempt to restart them, based on container's restart policy, defined in the Pod config. Options include **Always**, **OnFailure**, and **Never**.

For short-lived Pod, options include **OnFailure** and **Never**.


## Container resource sharing

Pods provide a shared execution environment for containers run inside it:
- Shared filesystem
- Shared network stack (IP address, routing table, portsâ€¦)
- Shared memory
- Shared volumes


## Scaling

Pods are the minimum unit of scaling.

If you need to scale an app, you add or remove Pods. You do not scale by adding more containers to existing Pods.


## Deploying

You'll rarely interact directly with Pods. You almost always deploy Pods via higher-level workload controllers (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs).

Controllers infuse Pods with super-powers such as self-healing, scaling, rollouts, and rollbacks.

Pods are ephemeral. They can be created, terminated, or replaced at any time. A new Pod has new ID and IP address. That's the reason why:
- applications should always store state and data outside the Pod.
- you shouldn't rely on individual Pods


## Pod immutability

Pods are immutable. You can't update a running Pod, you always replace it with a new Pod running the updates.

It follow the behaviors:
- When updates are needed, replace all old Pods with new ones
- When failures occur, replace failed Pods with new ones


## Multi-container Pods

Kubernetes allows you to run multiple containers within a single Pod.

Containers share the same network namespace and storage, enabling them to communicate and work together seamlessly.

Multi-container Pod patterns:
- Sidecar pattern
- Adapter pattern
- Ambassador pattern
- Init pattern

### Sidecar Pattern

A helper container enhances the functionality of the main container (e.g., logging or monitoring).

An example use case is log aggregation and analysis:
- Main Container: Runs the application (e.g., a web server like NGINX or a Java application).
- Sidecar Container: Runs a logging agent which collects logs from from shared storage and sends them to a central logging system

### Adapter Pattern

A container modifies or standardizes data for the main container.

An example use case is data transformation or standardization:
- You have a primary application container that consumes data from an external source
- And a container that transforms incoming data into a compatible format before passing it to the main container.


### Ambassador Pattern

A container acts as a proxy to external services.

An example use case is database proxy:
- Main Container: Runs an application that interacts with a database.
- Ambassador Container: Acts as a proxy for the database, handling tasks like authentication, load balancing, or connection pooling.


### Init pattern

The init pattern runs a special init container that:
- starts and completes before the main app container (the main app container will not start until the init container completes)
- only run once
- its job is to run tasks that initialise the environment for the main application container.
