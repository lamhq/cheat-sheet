# Pods

## Overview

A Pod is a set of containers that run your application, similar to a machine hosting multiple applications, each running on a different port.

Pods are the smallest units in Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.

A Pod can only be scheduled to a single node.


## Networking

The Pod's name will become the hostname of containers run inside it. It must be valid [DNS names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names).


## Pod lifecycle

A Pod after created enter the **pending** phase.

Once all containers are pulled and running, the Pod enters the **running** phase.

For short-lived Pods, after all containers in a Pod terminate successfully, the Pod enters the **succeeded** state.


## Scaling

Pods are the minimum unit of scaling.

If you need to scale an app, you add or remove Pods. You do not scale by adding more containers to existing Pods.


## Deploying

You'll rarely interact directly with Pods. You almost always deploy Pods via higher-level workload **controllers** (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs).

**Controllers** infuse Pods with super-powers such as self-healing, scaling, rollouts, and rollbacks.


## Pod immutability

Pods are immutable. You can't update a running Pod, you always replace it with a new Pod running the updates.

Pods are ephemeral (only lie a short time). They can be created, terminated, or replaced at any time. 

Each Pod gets its own IP address. There's no way to know Pod's IP address before it's scheduled.

That's why:
- applications should always store state and data outside the Pod.
- you shouldn't rely on individual Pods

When an update occured, all old Pods are updated with new ones.

When failures occur, failed Pods are replaced with new ones.


## Multi-container Pods

Kubernetes allows you to run multiple containers within a single Pod.

Containers in a Pod share the same IP address, memory, volumes, routing table. They communicate with each other via the Pod's `localhost` adapter and a port number.

Multi-container Pod patterns:
- Sidecar pattern
- Adapter pattern
- Ambassador pattern
- Init pattern

### Sidecar Pattern

A helper container enhances the functionality of the main container (e.g., logging or monitoring).

An example use case is log aggregation and analysis:
- Main Container: Runs the application (e.g., a web server like NGINX or a Java application).
- Sidecar Container: Runs a logging agent which collects logs from from shared storage and sends them to a central logging system

### Adapter Pattern

A container modifies or standardizes data for the main container.

An example use case is data transformation or standardization:
- You have a primary application container that consumes data from an external source
- And a container that transforms incoming data into a compatible format before passing it to the main container.


### Ambassador Pattern

A container acts as a proxy to external services.

An example use case is database proxy:
- Main Container: Runs an application that interacts with a database.
- Ambassador Container: Acts as a proxy for the database, handling tasks like authentication, load balancing, or connection pooling.


### Init pattern

The init pattern runs a special init container that:
- starts and completes before the main app container (the main app container will not start until the init container completes)
- only run once
- its job is to run tasks that initialise the environment for the main application container.
