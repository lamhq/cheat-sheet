# ConfigMaps

## Overview

ConfigMaps provide a way to store configuration information and provide it to containers.

You can store data in ConfigMaps as key-value pairs or as files:
- Store in a File. Key is the filename, value is the file contents (JSON, XML, keys/values, etc.)
- You can provide these values on the command-line
- You can define them in a ConfigMap manifest file

ConfigMap can be accessed from a Pod using:
- **Environment variables**: Use `envFrom` or `env` in your Pod spec to inject ConfigMap values as env vars.
- **ConfigMap volume**: Define a volume that sources from your ConfigMap and mount it inside your container, each key becomes a file.


## Creating a ConfigMap

### From a manifest file

Defining a ConfigMap in a manifest file:
```yml title="file.configmap.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
```
- `data`: ConfigMap data

Create from a ConfigMap manifest:
```sh
kubectl apply -f file.configmap.yml
```


### From a file

Defining Key/Value Pairs in a File:
```sh title="config.txt"
key1=value1
key2=value2
root.enabled=true
root.password=secret
```

Create a ConfigMap from a file:
```sh
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The file name becomes the key, and the file contents become the value.


### From an Environment File

```sh title=".env"
key1=value1
key2=value2
root.enabled=true
root.password=secret
```

```sh
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-env-file=.env
```

> [!NOTE]
> The file name is not included as a key.


## Using a ConfigMap

### In Command Line

Getting all ConfigMaps:
```sh
kubectl get cm -o yaml
```

Get a ConfigMap by name:
```sh
kubectl get cm config-name -o yaml
```

### In Pods

ConfigMap manifest:

```yml title="file.configmap.yml" {4,6}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-settings
data:
  enemies: aliens
  enemies.cheat: "true"
  enemies.cheat.level: noGoodRotten
```

**Access a ConfigMap value in Pods as an environment variable**:
```yml {8,11,12}
apiVersion: apps/v1
...
spec:
  template: ...
  spec:
    containers: ...
    env:
    - name: ENEMIES
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: app-settings
          key: enemies
```
- `ENEMIES` environment variable will be created (value=`aliens`)


To load all keys from a ConfigMap:
```yml
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: app-settings
```
- All keys from `app-settings` ConfigMap will be loaded as environment variables

**Access a ConfigMap as file**:
```yml
volumes:
- name: config-volume
  configMap:
    name: app-settings

containers:
  volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/config
```
- Each key in the ConfigMap becomes a file under `/etc/config` (`enemies`, `enemies.cheat`, `enemies.cheat.level`).
