# Ingress

## Overview

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

It allows you to define rules for routing traffic to different services based on hostnames, paths, or other criteria.

Ingress exposes multiple Services through a single cloud load-balancer.

To do this, Ingress creates a single LoadBalancer Service, on port 80 or 443, and uses host-based and path-based routing to send traffic to the correct backend Service.

Main components include:
- Ingress Resource: Defines routing rules.
- Ingress Controller: Implements those rules, routing traffic.


## Ingress Resource

An object that defines rules for traffic routing rules, such as which hostname or path maps to a target service.

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
```

- `name` of an Ingress object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.
- `annotations` are key-value pairs that help customize the behavior of the Ingress controller. Annotations vary depending on the Ingress controller you are using.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /`: modifies the request URL by rewriting the path to `/` before forwarding to the backend service.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "true"`: forces HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS


## Ingress Controller

A load balancer that implements the rules defined in the Ingress Resource. It receives and directs traffic to the correct backend services.

In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an ingress controller running.

A lot of Kubernetes clusters donâ€™t ship with a built-in Ingress controller. You may need to deploy an Ingress controller such as [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/). You can choose from a number of [Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).
