# Getting Started

## Create a Pod

Create the configuration file for a Pod that run a web server:

```yml title="pod.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Create pod:

```sh
kubectl apply -f pod.yml
```

Verify the created pod:
```sh
kubectl get pods
```


## Connect to container

By default, a Pod is only accessible by its internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster. 

To make the container accessible from local machine, you have to forward port:

```sh
kubectl port-forward nginx-pod 8080:80
```

Now you can access the website at http://localhost:8080/


## Cleanup

Delete pod:
```sh
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
```
