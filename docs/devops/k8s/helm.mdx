# Helm

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what Helm Charts are and why they matter:

## Overview

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, designed to simplify the deployment and management of applications.

It bundles all the Kubernetes manifests (like Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets) into a single, reusable package called a **Chart**.


## Helm Chart

A typical Helm Chart includes:
- `Chart.yaml`: Metadata about the chart
- `values.yaml`: Default configuration values
- `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes manifest templates
- Optional `charts/`: Dependencies
- Optional `README.md`: Documentation


## Benefits

- **Simplified complex application deployments**: Instead of manually applying many YAML files, you install one chart
- **Enables reusability and sharing**. Easily deploy the same application across different environments (dev, staging, prod) with different configurations
- **Manages release lifecycle of application**. Make it easy for versioning, upgrades, rollbacks
- **Parameterization**: Customize deployments using `values.yaml`
- **Dependency Management**: Handle app dependencies cleanly
- **CI/CD Integration**: Works well with GitOps tools like ArgoCD and FluxCD
