# Cluster Architecture

## Overview

![](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kubernetes-architecture-diagram-1-1-900x614.png)

A Kubernetes cluster consists of:
- **nodes**: a set of machines that run containerized applications. Every cluster needs at least one node.
- **control plane**: a set of controlling software that manages these nodes

A **node** may be a virtual or physical machine.

Kubernetes schedule **pods** that run on nodes. A pod consists of one or more containers that will be deployed together. You often have one container in a pod.

A **service** provides a stable network identity and a way to route traffic to a set of pods.

With a **replica set**, you define the desired state of a set of pods. Replica sets are managed via a deployment.

A **deployment** is how you apply changes to your pods and replica sets. Deployment allows rolling upgrades, rollbacks, scaling up the number of
nodes, ...


## Control Plane

The control plane manages nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

Control plane nodes are servers where the control plane components run. They can be physical servers, VMs, cloud instances and more.

Responsibilities:
- **Maintaining Cluster State**: ensures that the cluster's state matches the desired state.
- **Managing Workloads**: decides which nodes will run the workloads and ensures they are running as expected.
- **Network Policies**: manages network policies to ensure secure and efficient communication between different components of the cluster.
- **Scaling and Resilience**: enables automatic scaling of applications based on demand and maintains the desired system state even in the face of failures.


### kube-apiserver

The core component server that exposes the Kubernetes HTTP API.

All communication (internal and external) must go through the API server.

All requests to the API server are subject to authentication and authorization.


### etcd

A distributed key-value database that stores the entire configuration and state of the cluster

The database is replicated on every control plane node for high availability.

### kube-scheduler

Determines which node a new or modified Pod should run on. It isnâ€™t responsible for running Pods.


### kube-controller-manager

Runs a set of controllers to ensure the desired state matches the current state.

The controller manager is a controller of controllers, it spawns all the core controllers and monitors them.

Each controller is also extremely specialized and only interested in its own little corner of the Kubernetes cluster.

### cloud controller manager

Integrates with the underlying cloud provider.


## Node Components

Node (or worker nodes) are where applications run.

At a high-level they do three things:
- Watch the API server for new work assignments
- Execute work assignments
- Report back to the control plane (via the API server)

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment. They include:

### kubelet

kubelet service runs on every node, it registers the node with the cluster.

The kubelet watches the API server for new work tasks, executes the task and maintains a reporting channel to the control plane.


### kube-proxy

Manage the network rules that allow communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

It ensures each node gets its own unique IP address, and it implements local iptables or IPVS rules to handle routing and load balancing of traffic.


### Container Runtime

software responsible for running containers (Docker, containerd, and CRI-O, ...)
