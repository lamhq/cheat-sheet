# Concepts

Fundamental building blocks in Kubernetes:

1. **Pod**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing one or more containers that share storage, network, and specifications.

2. **ReplicaSet**: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running. Deployments usually manage ReplicaSets.

3. **Deployment**: Manages the lifecycle of pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas and allowing updates to applications seamlessly.

4. **Service**: Provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of pods. It enables load balancing and service discovery.

5. **Namespace**: Offers a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or applications, enabling resource isolation.

6. **ConfigMap**: Manages configuration data separately from the application code.

7. **Secret**: Stores sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, which can be used by pods.

8. **PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: PV represents storage in the cluster, and PVC allows pods to request specific storage resources.

9. **Ingress**: Manages external HTTP and HTTPS access to services within the cluster, typically using a reverse proxy.

10. **Node**: Represents a single worker machine in the cluster, where pods are scheduled and run.
