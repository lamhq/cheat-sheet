# Configuration

`kubectl` uses a configuration file to know which cluster and API server endpoint to send commands to. 

The configuration file located in `~/.kube/config`. It contains definitions for:
- Clusters: a list of Kubernetes clusters to work with
- Users: users with different levels of access.
- Contexts: group clusters and users together

The following is a simple kubeconfig file with:
- a cluster called `shield`
- a user called `coulson`
- a context called `director`. The `director` context
combines the coulson `user` and the `shield` cluster and is also set as the default context.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters: # <<==== Cluster definitions in this block
- cluster:
    name: shield
    certificate-authority: C:\Users\nigel\.minikube\ca.crt
    server: https://192.168.1.77:8443
users: # <<==== User definitions in this block
- name: coulson
  user:
    client-certificate: C:\Users\nigel\.minikube\client.crt
    client-key: C:\Users\nigel\.minikube\client.key
contexts: # <<==== Contexts in this block
- context:
    cluster: shield
    user: coulson
    name: director
current-context: director
```
