# Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.


## Key Features

1. **Automated Scaling**. **Kubernetes** can automatically adjust the number of running containers based on demand.
2. **Self-Healing**. Kubernetes detects failed containers and replaces them without requiring manual fixes.
3. **Load Balancing**. Kubernetes distributes traffic across multiple containers, ensuring reliability and preventing overload.
4. **Service Discovery & Networking**. Kubernetes manages internal and external service communication seamlessly.
5. **Multi-Host Management**. Kubernetes runs and orchestrates containers across multiple machines.
6. **Declarative Configuration & Desired State Management**. Kubernetes lets users define the ideal state of applications, and it continuously works to maintain that state.


## Container Benefits

1. **Quick Onboarding**. Containers help teams get up to speed quickly. Tools like Docker Compose allow developers to spin up an entire environment effortlessly.
3. **Avoiding Application Conflicts**. Developers can run multiple versions of the same application without conflicts by isolating them in separate containers.
4. **Consistent Environments**. Containers ensure that code runs reliably across different environments (local development, QA, production), eliminating the common "works on my machine" problem.
5. **Faster Software Delivery**. Containers streamline the software development and deployment process, accelerating delivery.


## Kubernetes Benefits

1. **Container Orchestration**. Kubernetes manages and coordinates containers across multiple nodes.
2. **Zero-Downtime Deployments**. Kubernetes enables seamless updates without service interruptions.
3. **Self-Healing Capabilities**. Kubernetes automatically detects and replaces failed containers.
4. **Horizontal Scaling**. Kubernetes makes it easy to scale applications by adding more pods (which contain containers) to a node.

Why developers should learn Kubernetes?

1. **Run Production-like Environments Locally**. Kubernetes helps emulate production for better testing.
2. **End-to-End & Performance Testing**. Kubernetes enables full environment testing with tools like **Selenium** or **Cypress.io**.
3. **Secrets & Configuration Management**. Ensures proper loading of secrets and configs across microservices.
4. **CI/CD & Build Servers**. Kubernetes automates builds, replaces failed containers, and streamlines deployment pipelines.
5. **Advanced Deployment Strategies**. Supports **zero-downtime, canary, A/B, and blue-green deployments** for safer rollouts.
6. **Troubleshooting in Production**. Helps developers assist **DevOps/IT** in diagnosing and resolving issues efficiently.


## Why not Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is simple, fast, and effective for local development but lacks the scalability, resilience, and orchestration needed for production environments.

1. **Single-host**. Docker Compose runs containers on **one machine**, while Kubernetes orchestrates containers across multiple nodes in a cluster.
2. **Simplified Networking**. Docker Compose lacks networking capabilities needed for distributed systems like **service discovery, load balancing, and network policies**.
3. **No Built-in Scaling or Self-Healing**. Docker Compose does not automatically **scale** containers or **restart** failed ones.
4. **Limited Deployment & Management Features**. Docker Compose lacks **rolling updates, zero-downtime deployments, and advanced scheduling** found in Kubernetes.
5. **Designed for Development & Testing**. Developers use Docker Compose to quickly set up **local environments** with databases, APIs, and dependencies.

## Running Kubernetes

Options for running Kubernetes locally:

### Docker Desktop
- The easiest way to enable Kubernetes if Docker is already installed.
- Supports one master node and one worker node, enough for basic Kubernetes tasks.
- To active: click on the **Preferences** menu (⚙️ gear icon), navigate to the Kubernetes tab, check the box **Enable Kubernetes**.
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Minikube
- A long-standing tool for running Kubernetes on a local machine.
- Provides a single master node and worker node setup.
- Supports full Kubernetes functionality via `kubectl`.
- Limitation: Cannot scale out like a production cluster.
- https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube

### Kubernetes in Docker
- Allows scaling out worker nodes beyond Docker Desktop’s limitations.
- A viable option for those needing more flexibility.

### kubeadm
- Used for setting up a full Kubernetes cluster, typically for administrators.
- More complex than other options, requiring additional configuration.
