# Routing

## Mapping rules

Rspress automatically scans the root directory and all subdirectories, and maps file paths to route paths.

For example, if you have the following file structure:

```
docs
├── foo
│   └── bar.md
└── foo.md
```

If `docs` is the root path (can be configured in Rspress config file), then:
- `bar.md` will be routed as `/foo/bar`
- `foo.md` will be routed to `/foo`

In addition to `.md(x)` files, you can also use `.tsx` files as [route components](https://rspress.dev/guide/basic/conventional-route#component-routing).

If you want to [customize the routing behavior](https://rspress.dev/guide/basic/conventional-route#custom-behavior) (e.g, exlude files), you can use the `route` field in the configuration file


## Structuring files

- place documentation files in the `docs` directory
- non-documentation content (functions, utils, ...) can be maintained outside the `docs` directory

```
docs
└── foo.mdx
src
├── components
│   └── CustomComponent.tsx
└── utils
    └── utils.ts
```
