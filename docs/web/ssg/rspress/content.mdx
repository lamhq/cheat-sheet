# Writting content

## Use React in Markdown file

Rspress supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful way to develop content.

You can use React components in Markdown files:

```md
import { CustomComponent } from './custom';

# Hello world

<CustomComponent />
```

MDX files can import each other:

```md
import Foo from './shared/foo.mdx';

# Hello world

<Foo />
```

## Page title and metadata

You can add Front Matter (YAML-formatted object) at the beginning of your Markdown file to define metadata

```md
---
title: Hello world
---
```

By default, Rspress uses h1 headings as html headings.

You can also access properties defined in Front Matter in the body:

```md
---
title: Hello world
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```


## Content Block

You can use [GitHub Markdown Alerts Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) to create custom blocks:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

> [!DETAILS]
> Collapsable content
```

> [!TIP]
> Using GitHub Markdown Alerts Syntax enable previewing the document on GitHub.

You can also use the `:::` syntax to create custom blocks with title:

```md
:::note
This is a `block` of type `note`
:::

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

:::details
This is a `block` of type `details` (toggleable)
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::
```


## Code block

````md
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

### Show line numbers

To display line numbers, you can enable the `showLineNumbers` option in the [config file](https://rspress.dev/api/config/config-build#markdownshowlinenumbers).


### Line highlighting

````md
```js title="hello.js" {1,3-5}
console.log('Hello World');

const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = 2;

console.log(b);
```
````


## Customizing title's anchor id

```md
## Hello world \{#custom-id}
```
