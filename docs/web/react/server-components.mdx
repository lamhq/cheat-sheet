# Server Components

## Overview

Server Components are React Components that are rendered at build time (without a server), or they can be run for each request using a web server.

They are sent to the client as serialized HTML, reducing the amount of JavaScript needed to be sent to the browser.

For example, the `<Page>` component is a Server Component that fetches data about a post, and passes it as props to the `<LikeButton>` which handles client-side interactivity.

```tsx filename="app/[id]/page.tsx" highlight={1,12} switcher
import LikeButton from '@/app/ui/like-button'
import { getPost } from '@/lib/data'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  const post = await getPost(id)

  return (
    <div>
      <main>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {/* ... */}
        <LikeButton likes={post.likes} />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```


## Use Cases

Use Server Components when you need:

- Fetch data from databases or APIs close to the source.
- Use API keys, tokens, and other secrets without exposing them to the client.
- Reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser.
- Improve the [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/), and stream content progressively to the client.


## Benefits

1. Reduce the amount of code sent and run by the client. This reduces the bundle size and improves loading times.
2. SEO-Friendly: search engines can crawl and index the page.
3. Server Components benefit from running on the server. They can access the local filesystem and may experience low latency for data fetches and network requests.


## Limitations

1. Server component can't have interaction or access DOM API.
2. Server Components cannot use most Hooks and cannot have their own state.
3. Require special server setup for deployment.
4. Increased Server Load.
