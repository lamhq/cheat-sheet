# List Virtualization

## Overview

List virtualization (aka. windowing) is a technique for rendering large lists or tables efficiently.


## How it works?

Instead of rendering all items in a list at once, it only renders the visible items within a "window" or viewport.

As the user scrolls, the window moves, and new items are rendered while old ones are removed.

This approach significantly improves performance by reducing the number of DOM elements.


## Implementations

Approaches to implement list virtualization: 
- [`react-window`](https://react-window.vercel.app/)
- [`react-virtualized`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)
