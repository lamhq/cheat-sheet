# Code Splitting

## Overview

Code splitting is a technique to optimize load time by breaking down large bundles of code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.


## Implementation

Use Dynamic Imports to import components or modules only when needed:
```jsx
const LazyComponent = () => import('./components/LazyComponent');
```

Use `React.lazy()` to lazy-load routes with React Router:
```jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Home = lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./pages/About'));

<Route path="/" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}><Home /></Suspense>
} />
<Route path="/about" element={
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}><About /></Suspense>
} />
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the bundler encounters the `import()` syntax, it automatically splits the relevant code into a new chunk and loads it on-demand at runtime.
