# React Router

## Version

This document is for version `7.6.3` (2025).

There're three ways (modes) to use React Router, each has different usage:
- Declarative: enables basic routing features
- Data: adds data loading, actions, pending states, ...
- Framework: built on top of Data Mode with a Vite plugin. Adds SSR, static rendering, code splitting, and type-safe routing.

This document is for **Data** mode. Because it has necessary features and easy to integrate to existing projects.


## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react-router" />


## Basic Usage

Use React Router in the application:

```tsx showLineNumbers {1-4,9-14,19} title="index.tsx"
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  RouterProvider,
} from "react-router";

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <div>Hello World</div>,
  },
]);

const root = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.createRoot(root).render(
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
);
```
