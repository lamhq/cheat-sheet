# Concepts

## Server Rendering

On the server, the rendering work is split into chunks, by individual route segments.

- Server Components are rendered into a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC Payload).
- Client Components and the RSC Payload are used to prerender HTML (partial prerendering).

There're two types of server rendering: **Static Rendering** (or Prerendering) and **Dynamic Rendering**.


### RSC Payload

The RSC Payload is a compact binary representation of the rendered React Server Components tree. It's used by React on the client to update the browser's DOM.

The RSC Payload contains:
- The rendered result of Server Components
- Placeholders for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files
- Any props passed from a Server Component to a Client Component


### Static Rendering

With Static Rendering, HTML is generated ahead of time (build time or [revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/incremental-static-regeneration)).

The result is cached and shared across users and requests.


### Dynamic Rendering

With Dynamic Rendering, content is generated at request time, based on request-time data.

A component becomes dynamic if it uses the following APIs:

- `cookies`
- `headers`
- `connection`
- `searchParams`
- `draftMode`
- `fetch` with `{ cache: 'no-store' }`
- ...

If a component doesnâ€™t use Dynamic APIs, but you want it to be dynamically rendered at runtime and not statically rendered at build time. You can use `connection()` function:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { connection } from 'next/server'
 
export default async function Page() {
  await connection()
  // Everything below will be excluded from prerendering
  const rand = Math.random()
  return <span>{rand}</span>
}
```


### Partial Prerendering

> [!CAUTION]
> This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production.

Partial Prerendering (PPR) is a mix of Static Rendering and Dynamic Rendering.

It allows the dynamic parts of the page to be rendered at request time, while the static shell is **prerendered**:
- Dynamic parts: components that use dynamic APIs
- Static shell: layout, components don't depend on request-time data

The dynamic parts are marked by wrapping them in a `Suspense` boundary (otherwise, it will cause a build error):

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { User, AvatarSkeleton } from './user'
 
export const experimental_ppr = true
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>This will be prerendered</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<AvatarSkeleton />}>
        <User />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  )
}
```

```tsx title="app/user.tsx"
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
 
export async function User() {
  // This component use a dynamic API `cookies`
  const session = (await cookies()).get('session')?.value
  return '...'
}
```

You can enable PPR by adding the `ppr` option to your `next.config.ts` file:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
```

Then add `experimental_ppr = true` in your `layout.tsx` file:

```tsx title="app/dashboard/layout.tsx"
export const experimental_ppr = true

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // ...
}
```

> [!INFO]
> * `experimental_ppr` will apply to all children of the route segment.
> * To disable PPR for children segments, you can set `experimental_ppr` to `false` in the child segment.


## Client Rendering

With the response from server, on the client:

1. **HTML** is used to immediately show a fast non-interactive preview of the route to the user.
2. **RSC Payload** is used to reconcile the Client and Server Component trees.
3. **JavaScript** is used to hydrate Client Components and make the application interactive.

On subsequent navigations:

- The **RSC Payload** is prefetched and cached for instant navigation.
- **Client Components** are rendered entirely on the client, without the server-rendered HTML.

> [!INFO]
> Hydration is React's process for attaching event handlers to the DOM, to make the static HTML interactive.


## Prefetching

Next.js prefetches routes that user is likely to visit on client-side.

Then if the prefetched route is requested, it performs [client-side transitions](#client-side-transitions) to update the page with rendered content.

This allow smooth and fast navigation, instead of waiting for the server to respond before the new route can be shown.

**How it work?**:
- Routes rendered with the `<Link>` component are automatically prefetches when in the user's viewport.
- The full route can be prefetched if it's a static route.
- For dynamic routes, the route will be skipped or partially prefetched if `loading.tsx` is present (streaming).


## Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client (partially prefetch), rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered.

This allows the user to see parts of the page immediately, before the entire content has finished rendering.

![Diagram showing partially rendered page on the client, with loading UI for chunks that are being streamed.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/server-rendering-with-streaming.png)

Shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

To use streaming:
1. Create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder
2. Wrapping a component with `<Suspense>`

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

```tsx title="app/dashboard/loading.js"
export default function Loading() {
  // Define the Loading UI here
  return <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.


## Client-side transitions

Client-side transitions work by instead of reloading the full page, it updates the content dynamically by:

- Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
- Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.

Client-side transitions when paired with prefetching and streaming, it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.
