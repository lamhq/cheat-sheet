# Concepts


## Server Rendering

In Next.js, Layouts and Pages are React Server Components by default.

On initial and subsequent navigations, the Server Component Payload is generated on the server before being sent to the client.

There are two types of server rendering:
- **Static Rendering (or Prerendering)** happens at build time or during revalidation, and the result is cached.
- **Dynamic Rendering** happens at request time in response to a client request.


## Prefetching

Instead of waiting for the server to respond before the new route can be shown, Next.js prefetches routes the user is likely to visit on client-side and performs client-side transitions.

Next.js automatically prefetches routes rendered with the `<Link>` component when they enter the user's viewport.

The full route can be prefetched if it's a static route. For dynamic routes, the route will be skipped or partially prefetched if `loading.tsx` is present (streaming).


## Streaming

Streaming allows the server to send parts of a dynamic route to the client (partially prefetch) as soon as they're ready, rather than waiting for the entire route to be rendered.

Shared layouts and loading skeletons can be requested ahead of time.

To use streaming, create a `loading.tsx` in your route folder:

![loading.js special file](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/loading-special-file.png)

The prefetched fallback UI will be shown while the route is loading, and swapped for the actual content once ready.


## Client-side transitions

Client-side transitions work by instead of reloading the full page, it updates the content dynamically by:

- Keeping any shared layouts and UI.
- Replacing the current page with the prefetched loading state or a new page if available.

Client-side transitions when paired with prefetching and streaming, it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.
