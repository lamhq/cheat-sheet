# Code Splitting

## Overview

Code splitting is a technique to optimize app's performance by breaking down large bundles of code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, instead of loading the entire app's code upfront, which can slows down the app.


## Implementation

Splitting code by route, when integrated with bundling and data fetching, can reduce the initial load time of your app and the time it takes for the largest visible content of the app to render (Largest Contentful Paint).

1. Use the `import()` syntax to load modules dynamically.
   ```js
   import("./module").then(module => {
     console.log(module.someFunction());
   });
   ```
2. Use `React.lazy()` to load components lazily. Combine it with `<Suspense>` for a loading fallback:
   ```js
   const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

   <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
     <LazyComponent />
   </Suspense>
   ```
3. Configure code splitting for your build tools (Vite, Parcel, Rsbuild)

> [!NOTE]
> When the bundler encounters the `import()` syntax, it automatically splits the relevant code into a new chunk and loads it on-demand at runtime.
