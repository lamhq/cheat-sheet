# Web Workers

## Overview

Web Workers are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to run scripts in the background, separate from the main UI thread. 

Useful for handling tasks that are computationally intensive or time-consuming, ensuring the UI remains smooth and responsive:
- Working with large datasets: sorting, filtering, complex calculation
- Image manipulation: resizing, croping, applying filters
- Video or Audio processing
- Cryptography: encryption, decryption, or hashing
- Manage WebSocket communication


## How it work?

Web Workers operate in a different thread from the main UI thread, they can perform tasks without interfering with the rendering or user interactions.

The main thread and the worker thread communicate via messages. You send data to the worker using `postMessage`, and the worker responds with `onmessage`

Web Workers cannot directly manipulate the DOM. This ensures that the main thread remains focused on UI-related tasks.


## Example

This example define a web worker in a JavaScript file `worker.js`:

```js title="worker.js"
self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const data = event.data;
  const result = performHeavyTask(data);
  self.postMessage(result);
};

function performHeavyTask(data) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < data; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Create an instance of the Web Worker in a React app and offload heavy computation to the worker:
```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);

  const handleHeavyTask = () => {
    const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url)); // Path to the worker file
    worker.postMessage(100000000); // Send data to the worker
    worker.onmessage = (event) => {
      setResult(event.data); // Receive the result
      worker.terminate(); // Clean up the worker
    };
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web Worker Example</h1>
      <button onClick={handleHeavyTask}>Start Heavy Task</button>
      {result && <p>Result: {result}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
