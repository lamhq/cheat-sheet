# useTransition

## Overview

`useTransition` is a React hook that let you update state without blocking the UI.

It improves application responsiveness and user experience.

Useful for managing transitions between different states in your application, when it involves some form of asynchronous or computationally expensive operation.

## How it work?

When `startTransition` is called, React renders the new UI in the background. This process doesn't block the browser's main thread, so urgent tasks like user interactions can continue seamlessly.

After the new UI is rendered in the background and is ready, React swaps it into place, committing it to the screen.

While the background rendering happens, you can show a "pending" state using the `isPending` value from `useTransition`.

If a higher-priority update comes in during the background rendering, React pauses background rendering to handle the urgent update first. Then resumes rendering the non-urgent updates once completed.


## Example

In the example below, while the list is being updated, the button shows a "pending" state without blocking other interactions on the UI.

```js
import { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [list, setList] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleUpdateList = () => {
    startTransition(() => {
      const newList = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i);
      setList(newList);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleUpdateList}>
        {isPending ? 'Updating...' : 'Update List'}
      </button>
      <ul>
        {list.map((item) => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
