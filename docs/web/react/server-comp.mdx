# Server Components

## Overview

Server Components are a new type of Component that renders ahead of time, before bundling, on the web or CI server.

Server Components are rendered and sent to the client as serialized HTML, reducing the amount of JavaScript needed to be sent to the browser.


## Benefits

1. Server send less JavaScript to the client. This reduces the bundle size and improves loading times.
2. Client is more lightweight and reduces its maintenance overhead.
3. SEO-Friendly: search engines can easily crawl and index the page.
4. Server Components can fetch data directly on the server without exposing APIs to the client, enhances security and reduces network requests


## Disadvantages

1. Increased Server Load.
2. Server component can't have interaction or access DOM API
3. Increase the latency for sending content from server
4. Increase development complexity. Mixing between client and server components make the code more complicated.
5. Require special server setup for deployment


## How it work?

Server components can run at build time to read from the filesystem or fetch static content, so a web server is not required.

```js
import marked from 'marked'; // Not included in bundle
import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // Not included in bundle

async function Page({page}) {
  // NOTE: loads *during* render, when the app is built.
  const content = await file.readFile(`${page}.md`);
  
  return <div>{sanitizeHtml(marked(content))}</div>;
}
```

The rendered output can then be server-side rendered to HTML and uploaded to a CDN. When the app loads, The client will only see the rendered output, no need to download the original `Page` component, or the expensive libraries. 


## Client Components

Server Components are not sent to the browser, they cannot use interactive APIs like `useState`.

To add interactivity to Server Components, you can compose them with Client Component.

Client Components use the `"use client"` directive.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no directive for Server Components. The `"use server"` directive is used for Server Functions.

An example client component:
```js
// Client Component
"use client"

export default function Expandable({children}) {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}
      >
        Toggle
      </button>
      {expanded && children}
    </div>
  )
}
```
