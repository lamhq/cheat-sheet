# Effect

## Side Effects

Side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of the component rendering process.

Examples:
- Starting an animation
- Changing the data
- Fetching data from an API
- Subscribing to a data stream or event
- Setting up timers or intervals
- Manually updating the DOM
- Logging or analytics
- Saving data to local storage

Side effects should go in event handlers (functions triggered by user actions, like clicking a button).

If no suitable handler exists, use `useEffect` to run the side effect after rendering, but it should be the last resort.


## Effect

Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

- By default, Effects run after every render.
- If specifying dependencies, effects should only re-run when it's dependencies change.
- Some Effects need to specify how to clean up what they were doing.

Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. 

Effects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. Whenever you write an Effect, consider wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.

For example:

1. We have a `VideoPlayer` component that render the built-in browser `<video>` tag, it accept `src` and `isPlaying` props
2. When `isPlaying` prop change, we want to play/pause the video. But the `<video>` tag doesn't have a `isPlaying` prop
3. We synchronize the value of `isPlaying` prop to tells whether the video should be playing by getting a ref to the `<video>` DOM node, and then call its `play()` and `pause()` methods when `isPlaying` prop changes

```jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isPlaying) {
      ref.current.play();
    } else {
      ref.current.pause();
    }
  }, [isPlaying]);

  return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;
}
```


## Effect Dependencies

You can control when to run an effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the `useEffect` call.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs after every render
});

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs only on mount (when the component appears)
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  // This runs on mount, and also if either a or b have changed since the last render
}, [a, b]);
```

> [!NOTE]
> You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don't match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect.   

If you don’t want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not “need” that dependency.

**Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies**. If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time.


## Cleanup Function

React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts. 

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  connection.connect();
  return () => {
    connection.disconnect();
  };
}, []);
```


## Development mode

In development, React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount (React intentionally unmounts and remounts it).

This ensure your effects and cleanup logic are correct. When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again.

In this example, your code doesn’t close the connection when the component unmounts, so `"✅ Connecting..."` gets printed twice:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function createConnection() {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected.');
    }
  };
}

export default function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection();
    connection.connect();
  }, []);
  return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>;
}
```


## When to use Effects?

1. [Controlling non-React widgets](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#controlling-non-react-widgets) (map, modal, video player, etc)
2. [Subscribing to events](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#subscribing-to-events) (scroll, resize, etc)
3. [Triggering animations](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#triggering-animations) (fade in, slide down, etc)
4. [Fetching data](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#fetching-data) (API, database, etc)
5. [Sending analytics](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#sending-analytics) (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc)


## When not to use Effects

If there is no external system involved, you shouldn’t need an Effect.

1. [Initializing the application](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#not-an-effect-initializing-the-application). You can put it outside your components
2. [Handling user events](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#not-an-effect-buying-a-product). This should go to event handlers
3. [Updating state based on props or state](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#updating-state-based-on-props-or-state). Just calculate it during rendering.


## Removing Non-Reactive Values from Effect Dependencies

> [!CAUTION]
> This guide uses an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React. However, the problem is common enough to be worth mentioning.

Sometimes your effect dependencies include values that you don't want to trigger a re-run when they change.

For example:
1. You want to show a notification each time a user connects to a different chat room.
2. But your code references the `theme` value, so you include it in the effect's dependency array.
3. This causes the app to reconnect and show a notification even when only the `theme` changes.

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification(`Connected to room ${roomId}!`, theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId, theme]);
  
  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
}  
```

You can remove `theme` from the dependency array, but you'll get a lint error.

You might be tempted to suppress the dependency linter, but doing so disables warnings when your effect should respond to new reactive dependencies added later. This leads to bugs.

React provides the `useEffectEvent` hook, which lets you extract non-reactive logic from your effect. This allows you to safely remove non-reactive values from the dependency array.

The above example can be refactored to:

```jsx
import { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from 'react';

function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent((room) => {
    showNotification(`Connected to room ${room}!`, theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected(roomId);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);

  return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
}
```
- `onConnected` is called an Effect Event. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always “sees” the latest values of your props and state.
- Now you can remove `theme` from the list of your Effect's dependencies, and the lint error will go away.

Limitations:

- Only call Effect Event from inside Effects.
- Never pass them to other components or Hooks.
