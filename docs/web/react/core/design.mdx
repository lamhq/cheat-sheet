# Design Components

A process for converting a design mock-up into a React component hierarchy.

## Start with the mockup

## Design the component hierarchy

Draw boxes around every component / subcomponent in the mockup and name them.

Split up the design into components using single responsibility principle.

> [!INFO] A component should ideally only do one thing. If it grows, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

Arrange components into a hierarchy:

- `FilterableProductTable`
  - `SearchBar`
  - `ProductTable`
    - `ProductCategoryRow`
    - `ProductRow`


## Build a static version

Build a non-interactive version that renders your data model. It includes components that reuse other components and pass data using props.

Don't use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity.

You can either build "top down" (starting with parent components) or "bottom-up" (starting with child components). On larger projects, it's easier to go "bottom-up".

The component at the top of the hierarchy will take your data model as a prop (e.g., `products` model) and pass it down to lower-level components.


## Design a minimal state structure

To make your UI interactive, you'll need to use state to track data that changes over time.

Keep your state DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Only store the minimal necessary data and compute everything else on-demand (like a total count or a filtered list).

Things that aren't state:
- Remain unchanged over time
- Is passed through props
- Can be computed from existing state or props

## Identify Where State Should Live

Once you've defined your app's state, you need to decide which component will **own and manage** that state. 

For each piece of state:
1.  **Find all components** that use the state to render their output.
2.  **Locate their closest common parent** in the component hierarchy.
3.  **Place the state** in that common parent component. If that doesn't feel right, you can move it to a component higher up, or even create a new component just to hold the state.


## Add inverse data flow

Allowing changing state by passing state update functions down to child components.
