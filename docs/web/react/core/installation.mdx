# Installation

## Creating a React App

### Using frameworks

1. Next.js (App Router)
   - A Full-stack web framework that support server-side rendering (SSR), and static-site generation (SSG)
   - Next.js app can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js
   - Next.js also supports static export which doesn't require a server.
    ```sh
    npx create-next-app@latest
    ```
2. Expo (for native apps)
   - Lets you create universal Android, iOS, and web apps with truly native UIs
   ```sh
   npx create-expo-app@latest
   ```

### From scratch

1. Install a build tool to scaffold a client-only, single-page app (SPA). You can use Vite, Parcel or Rsbuild
   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
   ```
2. Set up [Routing](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch#routing)
3. Select a [Data Fetching](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch#data-fetching) library
   > [!NOTE] 
   > Fetching data directly in components can lead to slower loading times due to network request waterfalls, it's recommended to prefetch data in router loaders or on the server. This allows a page's data to be fetched all at once as the page is being displayed.
4. Configure [Code Splitting](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch#code-splitting)
5. Support other [rendering strategies](https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch#improving-application-performance) to improve performance
