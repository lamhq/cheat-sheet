# Reducer 

## Motivation

Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming.

For these cases, you can **consolidate all the state update logic** outside your component in a single function, called a reducer.

For example, your state is an array of objects and you want to add,remove and update individual object in the array:
- The state update logic is spread across many event handlers.
- It can get harder to see how the component's state gets updated as your components grow.

```js
export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    setTasks([
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: nextId++,
        text: text,
        done: false,
      },
    ]);
  }
  
  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a "reducer".


## Reducer function 

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic.

It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state.

```js
function yourReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'your-action': {
      // return next state for React to set
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}
```

Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:
- Reducers must be pure. Same inputs always result in the same output
- Each action describes a single user interaction. _For example, if user Reset on a form with 5 inputs, we dispatch a `reset_form` action rather than 5 separate `set_field` actions_.


## Action

An action object can have any shape.

By convention, it is common to give it a string `type` that describes what happened, and you can pass any additional information in other fields.

```js
dispatch({
  // specific to component
  type: 'what_happened',
  // other fields go here
});
```


## Writing oncise reducers with Immer 

Just like with updating objects and arrays in regular state,  `useImmerReducer` lets you write concise reducers.

```js title="reduces.js"
export function tasksReducer(draft, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      draft.push({
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false,
      });
      break;
    }
    case 'changed': {
      const index = draft.findIndex((t) => t.id === action.task.id);
      draft[index] = action.task;
      break;
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return draft.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}
```

```jsx title="App.js"
import { useImmerReducer } from 'use-immer';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import { tasksReducer } from './reduces.js';

export default function App() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useImmerReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task,
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];
```


## `useState` vs `useReducer`

**Code size**:
- `useState` help you write less code when the state updates are simple
- `useReducer` can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.

**Readability**:
- `useState` is very easy to read when the state updates are simple.
- `useReducer` lets you separate the update logic from event handlers.

**Debugging**:
- It can be difficult to tell where the state was set with `useState` because there's only one `setState` function.
- With `useReducer`, you can add a console log into your reducer to see which action triggered the state update.

**Testing**:
- You can test reducer function separately in isolation


## Where to use `useReducer`?

1. State update happens in multiple places
2. State update logic is complex (`get`, `set` is not enough)
3. State structure is complex (nested objects and arrays).
