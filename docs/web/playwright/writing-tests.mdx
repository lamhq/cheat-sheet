# Writing tests

## Overview

A Playwright test includes steps to:
- perform actions on a web page
- assert the state against expectations

There is no need to wait to performing an action.

Tests are isolated. Each test runs in a clean, independent environment.

> [!INFO]
> By receiving a [page fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures), pages are isolated between tests due to the [Browser Context](https://playwright.dev/docs/browser-contexts), which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile.


## Test hooks

- `describe`: declare a group of tests
- `beforeEach`, `afterEach`: executed before/after each test
- `beforeAll`, `afterAll`: executed once per worker before/after all tests

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('navigation', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Go to the starting url before each test.
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  });

  test('main navigation', async ({ page }) => {
    // Assertions use the expect API.
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://playwright.dev/');
  });
});
```


## Locators

[Locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) represent a way to find element(s) on the page.

- `getByRole()` – locate elements by ARIA role and accessible name  
- `getByText()` – match visible text content  
- `getByLabel()` – target form controls by label text  
- `getByPlaceholder()` – locate inputs by placeholder text  
- `getByAltText()` – find images by alt attribute  
- `getByTitle()` – match elements by title attribute  
- `getByTestId()` – use custom `data-testid` attributes  
- `locator()` – use CSS or XPath selectors directly
- `frameLocator()` - access `iframe` HTML tag to perform interactions inside the frame


## Actions

Check [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/input) for all available actions.

### Page actions

- `page.goto(url)` – navigate to a specific URL  
- `page.screenshot()` – take a screenshot of the page  
- `page.pdf()` – generate a PDF (Chromium only)  
- `page.evaluate(fn)` – run custom JavaScript in the page context  
- `page.addInitScript()` – inject scripts before any page loads  
- `page.context().storageState()` – capture cookies and localStorage  

```ts
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
```

### Locator actions

- `locator.click()` – click on an element  
- `locator.fill()` – enter text into input fields  
- `locator.type()` – simulate typing character-by-character  
- `locator.press()` – press keyboard keys (e.g. Enter, Tab)  
- `locator.check()` / `locator.uncheck()` – toggle checkboxes  
- `locator.selectOption()` – choose from dropdown menus  
- `locator.hover()` – simulate mouse hover over an element  
- `locator.setInputFiles()` – upload files to input fields  
- `locator.focus()` – set focus on an element  
- `locator.clear()` – clear input field content  
- `locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` – scroll element into view  
- `locator.screenshot()` – capture screenshot of the element  
- `locator.evaluate()` – run custom JavaScript on the element  
- `locator.isVisible()` – check if the element is visible  
- `locator.count()` – count number of matching elements


## Assertions

### Element State Assertions

- `toBeVisible()` – element is visible  
- `toBeHidden()` – element is hidden or not in DOM  
- `toBeEnabled()` – element is enabled  
- `toBeDisabled()` – element is disabled  
- `toBeChecked()` – checkbox or radio is checked  
- `toBeEditable()` – input is editable  
- `toBeEmpty()` – element has no text content  
- `toBeFocused()` – element is focused 
- `toHaveTitle()` – page has expected title  

### Content & Attribute Assertions
- `toHaveText()` – element has exact text  
- `toContainText()` – element contains partial text  
- `toHaveAttribute()` – element has specific attribute  
- `toHaveClass()` – element has specific class  
- `toHaveValue()` – input has a specific value  
- `toHaveCount()` – locator matches expected number of elements  
- `toHaveCSS()` – element has specific CSS property  

### Page-Level Assertions

- `toHaveURL()` – page has expected URL  
- `toHaveScreenshot()` – page matches screenshot  

### API & Response Assertions
- `toBeOK()` – response status is OK (200–299)
