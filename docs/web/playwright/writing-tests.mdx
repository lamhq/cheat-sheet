# Writing tests

## Overview

Playwright tests are simple, they:
- perform actions, and
- assert the state against expectations.

There is no need to wait to performing an action.

Tests are isolated (each test runs in a clean, independent environment). By receiving a [page fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures), pages are isolated between tests due to the [Browser Context](https://playwright.dev/docs/browser-contexts), which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile.


## Test file name

By default, Playwright automatically runs files that match: `.*(test|spec).(js|ts|mjs)`

These files are typically located in the `tests` directory. You can configure a different path in `playwright.config.ts` using the `testDir` option.

You can override the default pattern with `testMatch` in your config:

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files.
  testMatch: 'tests/**/*.spec.ts'
});
```


## Test hooks

- `describe`: declare a group of tests
- `beforeEach`, `afterEach`: executed before/after each test
- `beforeAll`, `afterAll`: executed once per worker before/after all tests

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('navigation', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Go to the starting url before each test.
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  });

  test('main navigation', async ({ page }) => {
    // Assertions use the expect API.
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://playwright.dev/');
  });
});
```


## Locators

Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page.

- `getByRole()` – locate elements by ARIA role and accessible name  
- `getByText()` – match visible text content  
- `getByLabel()` – target form controls by label text  
- `getByPlaceholder()` – locate inputs by placeholder text  
- `getByAltText()` – find images by alt attribute  
- `getByTitle()` – match elements by title attribute  
- `getByTestId()` – use custom `data-testid` attributes  
- `locator()` – use CSS or XPath selectors directly
- `frameLocator()` - access `iframe` HTML tag to perform interactions inside the frame

Check [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) for different types of locators available.


## Actions

### Page actions

- `page.goto(url)` – navigate to a specific URL  
- `page.screenshot()` – take a screenshot of the page  
- `page.pdf()` – generate a PDF (Chromium only)  
- `page.evaluate(fn)` – run custom JavaScript in the page context  
- `page.addInitScript()` – inject scripts before any page loads  
- `page.context().storageState()` – capture cookies and localStorage  

```ts
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
```

### Locator actions

- `locator.click()` – click on an element  
- `locator.fill()` – enter text into input fields  
- `locator.type()` – simulate typing character-by-character  
- `locator.press()` – press keyboard keys (e.g. Enter, Tab)  
- `locator.check()` / `locator.uncheck()` – toggle checkboxes  
- `locator.selectOption()` – choose from dropdown menus  
- `locator.hover()` – simulate mouse hover over an element  
- `locator.setInputFiles()` – upload files to input fields  
- `locator.focus()` – set focus on an element  
- `locator.clear()` – clear input field content  
- `locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` – scroll element into view  
- `locator.screenshot()` – capture screenshot of the element  
- `locator.evaluate()` – run custom JavaScript on the element  
- `locator.isVisible()` – check if the element is visible  
- `locator.count()` – count number of matching elements

Check [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/input) for a list of available actions.


## Assertions

Playwright support different types of assertions:

- **Non-retrying assertions** (generic matchers): Evaluate conditions once, useful for deterministic checks (e.g. `expect(value).toBe(42)`)
- **Auto-retrying assertions**: Automatically wait for conditions like visibility, text, or state to be met (e.g. `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`)
- **Soft assertions**: Allow tests to continue even if the assertion fails, useful for diagnostics
- **Negating matchers**: Assert that something is _not_ true (e.g. `expect(locator).not.toBeVisible()`)
- **Custom matchers**: Extend `expect()` with your own logic using `expect.extend()`
- **Polling assertions**: Retry custom logic until it passes using `expect.poll()` or `expect.toPass()`

### Element State Assertions

- `toBeVisible()` – element is visible  
- `toBeHidden()` – element is hidden or not in DOM  
- `toBeEnabled()` – element is enabled  
- `toBeDisabled()` – element is disabled  
- `toBeChecked()` – checkbox or radio is checked  
- `toBeEditable()` – input is editable  
- `toBeEmpty()` – element has no text content  
- `toBeFocused()` – element is focused 
- `toHaveTitle()` – page has expected title  

### Content & Attribute Assertions
- `toHaveText()` – element has exact text  
- `toContainText()` – element contains partial text  
- `toHaveAttribute()` – element has specific attribute  
- `toHaveClass()` – element has specific class  
- `toHaveValue()` – input has a specific value  
- `toHaveCount()` – locator matches expected number of elements  
- `toHaveCSS()` – element has specific CSS property  

### Page-Level Assertions

- `toHaveURL()` – page has expected URL  
- `toHaveScreenshot()` – page matches screenshot  

### API & Response Assertions
- `toBeOK()` – response status is OK (200–299)
