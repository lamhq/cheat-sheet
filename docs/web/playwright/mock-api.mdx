# Mock API requests

## Overview

Playwright provides APIs to mock and modify network traffic, both HTTP and HTTPS.

Any requests that a page does, including XHRs and fetch requests, can be tracked, modified and mocked.


## Mock API requests

The following code will intercept all the calls to */**/api/v1/fruits and will return a custom response instead. No requests to the API will be made. 

```ts
test("mocks a fruit and doesn't call api", async ({ page }) => {
  // Mock the api call before navigating
  await page.route('*/**/api/v1/fruits', async route => {
    const json = [{ name: 'Strawberry', id: 21 }];
    await route.fulfill({ json });
  });
  // Go to the page
  await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

  // Assert that the Strawberry fruit is visible
  await expect(page.getByText('Strawberry')).toBeVisible();
});
```


## Modify API responses

In the example below we intercept the call to the fruit API and add a new fruit called "Loquat" to the response:

```ts
test('gets the json from api and adds a new fruit', async ({ page }) => {
  // Get the response and add to it
  await page.route('*/**/api/v1/fruits', async route => {
    const response = await route.fetch();
    const json = await response.json();
    json.push({ name: 'Loquat', id: 100 });
    // Fulfill using the original response, while patching the response body
    // with the given JSON object.
    await route.fulfill({ response, json });
  });

  // Go to the page
  await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/api-mocking');

  // Assert that the new fruit is visible
  await expect(page.getByText('Loquat', { exact: true })).toBeVisible();
});
```


## Mocking with HAR files

A HAR file is an HTTP Archive file that contains a record of all the network requests that are made when a page is loaded. It contains information about the request and response headers, cookies, content, timings, and more. You can use HAR files to mock network requests in your tests

You'll need to:

1. Record a HAR file.
2. Commit the HAR file alongside the tests.
3. Route requests using the saved HAR files in the tests.

For more information, see [Mocking with HAR files](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock#mocking-with-har-files).


## Mock WebSockets

Intercept WebSocket connections and return a mock response, instead of connecting to the server:

```ts
await page.routeWebSocket('wss://example.com/ws', ws => {
  ws.onMessage(message => {
    if (message === 'request')
      ws.send('response');
  });
});
```

Modify response:

```ts
await page.routeWebSocket('wss://example.com/ws', ws => {
  const server = ws.connectToServer();
  ws.onMessage(message => {
    if (message === 'request')
      server.send('request2');
    else
      server.send(message);
  });
});
```
