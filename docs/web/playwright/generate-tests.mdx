# Generate tests

You can use the [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) extension to generate tests by recording your actions.

**Benefits**:
- Great for writing test actions without writing code from scratch.
- Uses accessibility roles and text rather than brittle CSS selectors.

**Steps**:
1. Open the **Testing sidebar** in VS Code.
2. Click **Record new** (or **Record at cursor** if you want to insert steps into an existing test).
3. Navigate to the site you want to test.
4. Perform interactions in the browser as a normal user.
5. Each action is captured and written into a test file.

Example output:
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('recorded test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();
  await page.fill('#username', 'user1');
  await page.fill('#password', 'password123');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```

## Generate assertions

You can also **generate assertions** by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:

- **assert visibility**: assert that an element is visible
- **assert text**: assert that an element contains specific text
- **assert value**: assert that an element has a specific value
