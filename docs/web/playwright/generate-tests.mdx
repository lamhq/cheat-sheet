# Generate tests

## Introduction

You can use the [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) extension to generate tests (CodeGen) by recording your actions.

Instead of writing tests by hand, you can simply navigate through the browser while CodeGen captures your actions and converts them into reliable test code with proper locators and assertions.


## Benefits

- Great for writing test actions without writing code from scratch.
- Uses proper locators (accessibility roles and text) rather than brittle CSS selectors.


## Generate tests

1. Open the **Testing sidebar** in VS Code.
2. Click **Record new** (or **Record at cursor** if you want to insert code into an existing test).
3. Navigate to the site you want to test.
4. Perform interactions in the browser as a normal user.
5. Each action is captured and written into a test file.

You can also **generate tests when debugging**:
1. Set a breakpoint in your test.
2. Run your test in debug mode.
3. When paused at the breakpoint, use the **Pick Locator** tool in **Test Explorer** to display the recording toolbar in the browser.
4. Click the **Start Recording** button in the toolbar.
5. Each action is captured and written into the opening file in the IDE.

## Generate assertions

You can also **generate assertions** by choosing one of the icons in the toolbar and then clicking on an element on the page to assert against. The following assertions can be generated:

- **assert visibility**: assert that an element is visible
- **assert text**: assert that an element contains specific text
- **assert value**: assert that an element has a specific value

## Pick a Locator

Use the **Pick locator** tool and click on any element in the opened browser, Playwright will determine the best locator and copy it to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your code.
