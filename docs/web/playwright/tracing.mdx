# Tracing

## Overview

Tracing records a detailed log of test execution, including browser actions, page state, and network activity.

The output is a `.zip` trace file that can be opened in the **Playwright Trace Viewer**, a GUI tool for debugging.

It include:
- **DOM snapshots** before, during, and after each action  
- **Screenshots** rendered as a filmstrip  
- **Network requests and responses**  
- **Console logs and errors**  
- **Source code location** for each action  
- **Execution timeline** with duration and failure points  
- **Metadata** like browser type, viewport, and test duration

Use Cases:
- **Debugging flaky tests**: See exactly where and why a test failed  
- **CI troubleshooting**: Automatically record traces on failure or retry  
- **Visual inspection**: Replay test steps with DOM and screenshot context  
- **Performance analysis**: Identify slow actions or network bottlenecks  
- **Team collaboration**: Share trace files for remote debugging

Traces are normally run in a Continuous Integration(CI) environment, because locally you can use UI Mode for developing and debugging tests.


## Enable Tracing

In your config:
```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
use: {
  trace: 'on-first-retry' // or 'retain-on-failure', 'on', 'off'
}
```

Or manually in code:
```ts
await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });
await page.goto('https://example.com');

// ... test actions ...

await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
```

Or you can enable tracing when running tests with `--trace on`:
```sh
npx playwright test --trace on
```

## Viewing trace

Using command line to view a trace file:
```sh
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

Or open the HTML report, clicking on a test will open the detailed view where you can see more information on your tests such as the errors, the test steps and the trace:
```sh
npx playwright show-report
```
