# Debugging Tests

The [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) extension provides debugging tools to help you identify and fix issues in your tests.

You can:
- Set breakpoints
- Inspect variables
- View detailed error messages
- Get AI-powered suggestions to resolve test failures
- Use trace viewer to analyze test execution step-by-step


## Use Breakpoints

Set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter next to a line number. Right-click the test and select **Debug Test**.

## Pick locator

While debugging you can use the **Pick Locator** button to select an element on the page and see the locator that Playwright would use to find that element.

## Fix with AI

When a test fails, click the sparkle icon next to the error to get an AI-powered fix suggestion from Copilot.

## Use Trace Viewer

Enable the **Show Trace Viewer** option in the Playwright sidebar. When your test finishes, a detailed trace will automatically open, providing you with a complete timeline of your test execution.
