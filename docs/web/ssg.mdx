# Static Site Generators

## Overview

A Static Site Generator (SSG) takes content (like Markdown files) and templates, and processes them to produce static HTML files.

These files can then be served directly by a web server without the need for server-side processing.

This results in faster load times, improved security, and easier scalability.


## Advantages of static sites

- **Performance**: Static sites load very fast because they don't require server-side processing.
- **Security**: With no server-side code execution, the attack surface is reduced.
- **Scalability**: Static sites can handle high traffic with ease.
- **Cost-Effective**: Hosting static sites is often cheaper since they can be served from a simple web server or a CDN.

## Popular Static Site Generators
