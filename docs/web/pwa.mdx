# Progressive Web Apps

## Overview

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses progressive enhancement to provide users with a more reliable experience

A PWA:
- can be installed
- has an icon on the home screen, app launcher, launchpad, or start menu
- appears when you search for apps on the device
- opens in a standalone window, separated from a browser's user interface.
- works offline
- has access to higher levels of integration with the OS


## Testing

Use tools like Chrome DevTools' Lighthouse audit to check if your website meets PWA criteria.
