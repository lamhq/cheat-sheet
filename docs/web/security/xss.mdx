# Cross-Site Scripting

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web applications, compromising user interactions and stealing sensitive data.

## How it Works

1. Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable website.
2. When users visit the site, the script executes in their browser.
3. This can lead to data theft, [session hijacking](./sess-hij.mdx), or even full control over user accounts.


## Prevention Methods

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Ensure user input is properly filtered.
- [**Content Security Policy**](./csp.mdx): Restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts.
- **Escaping Output**: Encode data before rendering it in the browser.
