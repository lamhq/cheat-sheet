# SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a serious security vulnerability where attackers manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access.

This can lead to data theft, modification, or even complete control over the system.


## How it works

1. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields, such as login forms or search boxes.
2. If the application does not properly sanitize user input, the injected SQL code gets executed by the database.
3. This can allow attackers to retrieve sensitive data, bypass authentication, or manipulate database contents.


## Example

Consider a login form where a user enters their username and password:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = 'user' AND Password = 'pass';
```
An attacker could input:
```sql
' OR '1'='1
```
Resulting in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1' AND Password = '';
```
Since `1=1` is always true, the attacker gains access without valid credentials.


## Prevention Methods

- **Avoid buiding SQL statements manually** (string concatenation), use a library to prepared parameterized statements.
- **Input Validation**: Restrict user input to expected formats.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit database permissions to reduce attack impact.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: A protective barrier between users and applications, filtering out malicious requests before they reach the application.
