# Man-in-the-Middle 

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker secretly intercepts and manipulates communication between two parties without their knowledge.

This allows the attacker to steal sensitive data, modify transactions, or inject malicious content.


## How it Work

1. **Interception**: The attacker positions themselves between the user and the intended recipient (e.g., a website or server).
2. **Data Manipulation**: The attacker can alter or steal transmitted data, such as login credentials or financial information.
3. **Spoofing**: The attacker may impersonate a trusted entity to trick users into revealing sensitive information.


## Common Types of MITM Attacks

1. **Wi-Fi Eavesdropping**: Attackers set up rogue Wi-Fi hotspots to intercept user data.
2. **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session tokens to gain unauthorized access.
3. **DNS Spoofing**: Redirecting users to fake websites to steal credentials.
4. **SSL Stripping**: Downgrading HTTPS connections to HTTP to expose data.


## Prevention Methods

- **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt communication to prevent interception. `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header can enforce HTTPS
- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi**: Use VPNs to secure data transmission. VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security.
