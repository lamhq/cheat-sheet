# Cross-Site Request Forgery

## Overview

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a security vulnerability that tricks users into performing unintended actions on a web application where they are authenticated. Attackers exploit the trust between the user and the website to execute unauthorized requests.

## How it Works

- The attacker crafts a malicious request and embeds it in a webpage or email.
- When the victim, who is logged into the target website, interacts with the malicious content, their browser unknowingly sends the request.
- Since the request includes the victimâ€™s authentication credentials (like cookies), the website processes it as a legitimate action.

## Example

Imagine a banking website where users can transfer money using:

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
    <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="attacker_account">
    <input type="submit" value="Transfer">
</form>
```

An attacker could embed this form in a their compromised webpage and use JavaScript to auto-submit it when the victim visits the page (by sending deceptive emails or messages with links, for example), it will send a POST request to the bank and unknowingly transferring money.

## Prevention Methods

- **CSRF Tokens**: Generate unique tokens for each request to verify authenticity.
- **SameSite Cookies**: Restrict cookies from being sent with cross-site requests.
- **Referer & Origin Checks**: Validate request sources to ensure they originate from trusted domains.
- **User Authentication Prompts**: Require re-authentication for sensitive actions.
