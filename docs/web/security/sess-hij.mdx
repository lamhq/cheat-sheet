# Session hijacking

Session hijacking is a cyberattack where an attacker takes control of a user's active session on a website or application by stealing or manipulating the session token.

This allows the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.


## How it Works

1. Attackers steal session IDs through methods like network sniffing, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./xss.mdx), malware.
2. Once the attacker obtains a valid session ID, they use it to send requests to the web server.
3. The attacker can now perform any action the legitimate user could, including:
   - Accessing sensitive personal data (passwords, financial information).
   - Making unauthorized transactions.
   - Changing account settings or passwords.
   - Sending emails or messages from the compromised account.
   - Deploying ransomware or other malicious software.


## Prevention Methods

- **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt communication to prevent interception.
- **Secure Session Management**: Implement strong session ID generation and expiration policies.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Prevent client-side scripts from accessing session tokens.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.
