# Addons

## Overview

Addons are plugins that extend Storybook's core functionality. You can find them in the addons panel

- **Controls** allows you to interact with a component's args (inputs) dynamically. Experiment with alternate configurations of the component to discover edge cases.
- **Actions** help you verify interactions produce the correct outputs via callbacks. For instance, if you view the "Logged In" story of the Header component, we can verify that clicking the “Log out” button triggers the onLogout callback, which would be provided by the component that made use of the Header.
- **Interactions** provides a helpful user interface for debugging interaction tests with the play function.
- **Accessibility** helps you identify accessibility violations in your components.
- **Visual Tests** lets you pinpoint UI bugs in your local development environment by providing instant feedback directly in Storybook.
