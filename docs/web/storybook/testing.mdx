# Testing

Note: this guide is for project set up with Vitest.

## Installation

```sh
npx storybook add @storybook/addon-vitest
```

Once your project is set up, you will see a testing widget in the bottom of your sidebar. After running tests, you will also see test status indicators on sidebar items.


## Test types

Storybook Test supports a variety of testing types

### Render Tests

- Basic stories act as smoke tests.
- If a component renders without errors, the test passes.
- Useful for verifying that components load correctly in different states.

### Interaction Tests

- Use the `play` function to simulate user behavior (focused on functionality).
- Can include clicks, typing, form submissions, and more.
- Base on Vitest and Testing Library, allow viewing the component in a real browser.
- See more at [Interaction tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/interaction-testing).

> [!NOTE]
> But mocking in Storybook is limited, just stick with Vitest and React Testing Library for writting component tests.

### Accessibility (A11y) Tests

- Automatically check for issues like poor contrast, missing ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
- Requires `@storybook/addon-a11y` addon.
- Helps ensure compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG.
- See more at [Accessibility tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/accessibility-testing)

### Visual Regression Tests

- Take screenshots of stories and compare them across commits (easier to review).
- Supports cross-browser visual testing (using Chromatic cloud service)
- When enabled, every story is automatically turned into a test.
- Requires `@chromatic-com/storybook` addon.
- See more at [Visual tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/visual-testing)

### Snapshot Tests

- Capture the HTML output of a component and compare it over time.
- Detect unintended changes in markup or styling.
- See more at [Snapshot tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/snapshot-testing).

> [!NOTE]
> Vitest already have snapshot testing.
