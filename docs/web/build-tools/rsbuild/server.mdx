# Dev Server

## Overview

The dev server is started whe running `rsbuild dev` and `rsbuild preview` commands.

It provides features such as page preview, routing, and hot module reloading.


## View Static Assets

After starting the dev server, you can access `/rsbuild-dev-server` to view all static assets generated during the current build.


## Page Routing

By default, when a resource is not found, it will fallback to `index.html`:

```js title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default {
  server: {
    htmlFallback: 'index',
  },
};
```

You can customize the Fallback Behavior using `server.historyApiFallback` config.


## Configuration

You can [configure](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/server#configuration) the dev server using `dev` and `server` configs.
