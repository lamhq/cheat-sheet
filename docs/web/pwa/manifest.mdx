# Web app manifest

## Overview

The web app manifest is a file you create that tells the browser how you want your web content to display as an app in the operating system

It includes:
- app's name
- icon
- theme color

> [!WARNING]
> A web app manifest is required for your PWA to meet the installability criteria in every browser, although Chrome may still allow installation without it.


## Create a manifest

Create a JSON file that contains at least a `name` field:

```json title="manifest.json"
{
  "name": "My First Application",
  "short_name": "PWA",
  "description": "Demo of a PWA",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#eff1f2",
  "theme_color": "#296BE3",
  "start_url": ".",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Use your manifest

To make the browser aware of your web app manifest, you need to link it to your PWA using a `<link>` HTML element:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
```


## Debug the manifest

To ensure the manifest is set up correctly, you can use DevTools in every Chromium-based browser.

1. In the left pane, under **Application**, select **Manifest**.
2. Check the fields of the manifest as parsed by the browser.


## Manifest fields

### Basic

- `name`, `short_name`
- `start_url`: The URL the PWA should load when the user starts it from the installed icon, such as `/`. If you don't provide a start URL, the browser can use the URL the PWA was installed from as a start.
- `display`: specifies how your web app should be presented to users when launched
  - `fullscreen`: Launches the app in full-screen mode, without any browser UI
  - `standalone`: Removes most browser UI but keeps minimal system UI like the status bar.
  - `minimal-ui`: Displays a small set of browser controls, such as a back button and reload button.
  - `browser`: Opens the app in a regular browser tab with full browser UI.
- `id`: A string that uniquely identifies this PWA against others that may be hosted on the same origin. 
- `icons`: Array of images used as app icons
  - `src`: The path to the icon file. Make the file is accessible from the internet.
  - `type`: The MIME type of the icon file, such as `image/png`
  - `sizes`: The size of the icon, formatted as `<width>x<height>`. Required sizes are `192x192`, `512x512`

> [!CAUTION]
> While PNGs can include transparency, providing transparent icons may cause unexpected issues on some operating systems. For example, iOS, iPadOS, and Android 8 and later fill in the transparency with a background color out of your control. For better compatibility, use a square non-transparent icon.


### Maskable icons

Some operating systems, such as Android, can change the shape of icons from circles to squares to rounded-corner squares. To support these kinds of adaptive icons, you can provide a maskable icon using the purpose field.

To do so, provide a square image file that has its main icon contained within a “safe zone”: a circle centered in the icon with a radius of 40 percent of the width of the icon.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you don't provide a maskable icon, devices that expect them may shrink your icon and make it into the shape they need with a white background. If your maskable icon isn't displaying well, you can improve it by adding more padding.

Maskable icons should be 512 by 512 at least.
