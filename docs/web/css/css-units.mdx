# CSS Units

## Percentage

The Percentage `%` unit is relative to the parent element's dimensions (for most common CSS properties).

**How it works**:
- `width`/`height`: relative to parent's `width`/`height`.
- `padding`/`margin`: relative to parent's **`width`** (not height).
- `font-size`: relative to parent's **`font-size`**.
- `line-height`: relative to its **own `font-size`**.
- If the parent's width isn't set, `%` might not behave as expected.
- For vertical sizing (`height: %`), the parent must have a defined height, otherwise the browser can't calculate it.


## `vh`, `vw`

`vh` (Viewport Height) and `vw` (Viewport Width) are relative to the size of the browser's viewport, which is the visible area of the browser window.

`1vh` = 1% of the viewport height.

`vh` is ideal for elements that always take up a certain proportion of the screen's vertical space (hero section or a header).

`vw` is commonly used to make elements span the full width of the screen, or to create typography that scales fluidly as the viewport changes size.

> [!WARNING]
> `100vw` can sometimes cause a horizontal scrollbar because it includes the width of the vertical scrollbar in the calculation.


## `rem`

`rem` is relative to the **font size of the root HTML element** (`<html>`).

Most browsers set the font size of the `<html>` element to `16px`. So `1rem` would equal `16px`.

**Key characteristic:** `rem` provides a consistent and predictable scaling across your entire document.

**Use it for**:
- Font sizes. Because it respects user preferences. If a user has changed their default font size, `rem` will adjust accordingly, ensuring a better user experience.


## `em`

When using `em` unit for `font-size`, its value is relative to the **font size** of the **parent element**.

For `margin`, `padding`, `width`, and `height`, its value scales with the **element**'s font size, not the parent.

**Key characteristic**:
- Its value can change depending on where it's used in the document structure.
- `em` can lead to a compounding effect. If you have nested elements, and each uses `em` for its font size, the size will be multiplied down the hierarchy, which can sometimes be hard to manage.

**Example:**
- If a parent `div` has a font size of 20px, and a child `p` element inside it has `font-size: 1.5em;`, the `p` element's font size would be `30px` (1.5 * 20px).
- If that `p` element then contained a `span` with `font-size: 0.8em;`, the `span`'s font size would be `24px` (0.8 * 30px).

**Use it when**:
- You want an element's padding or margin to scale with its own font size.

**It may not be suitable for**:
- Font sizing due to the compounding effect


## Choosing the right units

### Font Sizes

Use `rem`.

Because `rem` units adapt to the user's browser settings. If a user has changed their default font size, `rem` will adjust accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> `px` will lock the font size in place, potentially overriding the user's accessibility preferences.


### Width

Consider Percentages(`%`) and `ch`.

Percentages is good starting point, often used in combination with a `max-width`.

**Character Unit (`ch`)**: is excellent for setting the `max-width` on paragraphs to ensure readability, as it's recommended to keep lines of text at around 75 characters or less.


### Height

You can use percentages, `rem`, or `vh` (viewport height).

> [!WARNING]
> Before setting a fixed `height`, consider using `min-height` instead. This ensures that if the content requires more vertical space, it will be accommodated without causing layout problems

> [!CAUTION]
> Be cautious with `vh` on mobile devices, as it can be inconsistent due to things like the on-screen keyboard.


### Padding & Margin

Use `em` if you want the padding or margin to scale with the font size of the element it's applied to.

*For example, using `em` for button padding allows the padding to grow or shrink when you change the button's font size.*

Use `rem` if you want the spacing to be consistent across different elements.

*For example, setting a `margin-top` of `1rem` on all text elements will ensure they have the same spacing regardless of their individual font sizes.*


### What about Pixels?

Pixels can be useful for very small, precise values like a shadow offset.

It's not recommended for font sizes, padding, or margins.
