# Tailwind CSS

## Version

This document is applied for version `3.4.4` (2024).


## How it work

Tailwind CSS works by:
1. Scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names
2. Generating the corresponding styles
3. Writing styles to a static CSS file.


## Why use it?

With Tailwind, you style elements by using utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS.

Benefits:
- It speeds up development significantly. Allowing to style HTML elemments directly.
- **You aren't wasting energy inventing class name**s.
- **You don't have to jump between multiple files to make changes**
- **Your CSS stops growing**. Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get bigger every time you add a new feature. With utilities, everything is reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS.
- **Making changes feels safer**. CSS is global and you never know what you're breaking when you make a change. Classes in your HTML are local, so you can change them without worrying about something else breaking.


### Why not just use inline styles?

Using utility classes has a few important advantages over inline styles:

- Designing with constraints. With utilities, you're choosing styles from a predefined design system, which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.
- Responsive design. You can't use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind's responsive utilities to build fully responsive interfaces easily.
- Hover, focus, and other states. Inline styles can't target states like hover or focus, but Tailwind's state variants make it easy to style those states with utility classes.


## Concerns

The biggest maintainability concern when using a utility-first approach is managing commonly repeated utility combinations. This is easily solved by:
- extracting components and partials
- using editor and language features like multi-cursor editing and simple loops.

Maintaining a utility-first CSS project is a lot easier than maintaining a large CSS codebase, because HTML is so much easier to maintain than CSS.


## Installation (React)

1. Install `tailwindcss` via `npm`, and create your `tailwind.config.js` file.
    <PackageManagerTabs command="install -D tailwindcss" />
    
    ```sh
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
1. Configure your template paths `tailwind.config.js`
    ```tsx
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    export default {
      content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```
2. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS (`index.css`)
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
3. Start your build process
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Start using Tailwind in your project
    ```tsx
    export default function App() {
      return (
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
          Hello world!
        </h1>
      )
    }
    ```


## Editor Setup

### VS Code

Install [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension.

Features included:
- Autocomplete. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as CSS functions and directives.
- Linting. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
- Hover Previews. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it.
- Syntax Highlighting. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.


### Prettier

Install [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts your classes following our [recommended class order](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).


## Optimizing for Production

If you're using Tailwind CLI, you can **minify your CSS** by adding the `--minify` flag:

```sh
npx tailwindcss -o build.css --minify
```

If you've installed Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin, add `cssnano` to the end of your plugin list:

```js title="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { cssnano: {} } : {})
  }
}
```

If you're using a framework, check the documentation as this is often handled for you in production automatically and you don't even need to configure it.


## Best practices

### Avoid dynamic class names

Always use complete class names.

Don't construct class names dynamically. If you use string interpolation or concatenate partial class names together, Tailwind will not find them and therefore will not generate the corresponding CSS.
