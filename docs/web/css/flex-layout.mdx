# Flex Layout

> *You could think of flexbox as "one dimensional."*


## Concepts

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/00-basic-terminology.svg)

- `main axis`: the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the `flex-direction` property.
- `main-start | main-end`: The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
- `main size`: A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size.
- `cross axis`: The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
- `cross-start | cross-end`: Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
- `cross size`: The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size.

## Properties for the Parent

### `display`

This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value.

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

- `flex`
- `inline-flex`


### `flex-direction`

This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

- `row` (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
- `row-reverse`: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
- `column`: same as row but top to bottom
- `column-reverse`: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

### `flex-wrap`

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

- `nowrap` (default): all flex items will be on one line
- `wrap`: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
- `wrap-reverse`: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

### `flex-flow`

This is a shorthand for the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is `row nowrap`.

```css
.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```


### `justify-content`

This defines the alignment along the main axis.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
```

- `flex-start` (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
- `flex-end`: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
- `center`: items are centered along the line
- `space-between`: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
- `space-around`: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.
- `space-evenly`: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

### `align-items`

This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.

```css
.container {
  align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch | baseline;
}
```

- `flex-start / start / self-start`: items are placed at the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end / end / self-end`: items are placed at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: items are centered in the cross-axis
- `stretch` (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect `min-width`/`max-width`)
- `baseline`: items are aligned such as their baselines align

### `align-content`

This aligns a flex **container's lines** within when there is extra space in the cross-axiss.

This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where `flex-flow` is set to either `wrap` or `wrap-reverse`). A single-line flexible container (i.e. where `flex-flow` is set to its default value, `no-wrap`) will not reflect align-content.

```css
.container {
  align-content: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
```

- `stretch`: lines stretch to take up the remaining space
- `flex-start / start`: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
- `flex-end / end`: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
- `center`: items centered in the container
- `space-between`: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
- `space-around`: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
- `space-evenly`: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them

### gap, row-gap, column-gap

The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items.

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gap-1.svg)

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  ...
  gap: 10px;
  gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */
  row-gap: 10px;
  column-gap: 20px;
}
```

## Properties for the Children

### `order`

```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```

### `flex-grow`

This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.

If all items have `flex-grow` set to `1`, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of `2`, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others.

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
}
```

### `flex-shrink`

This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
}
```


### `flex-basis`

This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.

- It can be a length (e.g. `20%`, `5rem`, etc.) or a keyword.
- The `auto` keyword means “look at my width or height property”
- The `content` keyword means “size it based on the item’s content”

```css
.item {
  flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
}
```


### `flex`

This is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined. The default is `0 1 auto`

```css
.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
```


### `align-self`

This allows the default alignment (in cross axis) to be overridden for individual flex items.

```css
.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```

## Tips

### Fill parent's width

Make children's width fill parent container using `flex-auto` (`flex: 1 1 auto`)

```html
<div class="flex">
  <label>Name:</label>
  <input class="flex-auto w-1" type="text">
</div>
```
