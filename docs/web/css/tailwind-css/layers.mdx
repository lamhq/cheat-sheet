# Layers

## Overview

Tailwind organizes the styles it generates into three different “layers”:
- The `base` layer is for things like reset rules or default styles applied to plain HTML elements.
- The `components` layer is for class-based styles that you want to be able to override with utilities.
- The `utilities` layer is for small, single-purpose classes that should always take precedence over any other styles.

```css title="main.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

...
```

## Why does Tailwind group styles into "layers"?

By grouping styles into layers, Tailwind ensures a sensible order of declarations, minimizing conflicts.

The `@layer` directive helps you control declaration order by automatically relocating your styles to the corresponding `@tailwind` directive, and also enables features like modifiers and tree-shaking for your own custom CSS.


## The `@layer` directive

The `@layer` directive lets you add styles to Tailwind’s `base`, `components`, and `utilities` layers.

```css title="main.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
  /* ... */
}
```
