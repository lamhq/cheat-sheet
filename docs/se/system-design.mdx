# System Design

## Overview

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase.

The desired outcome is to come up with an architecture that achieves system design goals with acceptable tradeoffs.


## Components of System Diagrams

Different building blocks of your diagrams:

## Diagram Drawing Tips

For better reading your diagrams:
- Try to maintain one direction of all your blocks. Left to right, top to bottom
- Actors should be on the same side
- Avoid intersections when connect your blocks. It's better to draw a longer direction that don't intersect
- Keep your connection vertical and horizontal, not diagonal
- Keep blocks aligned
