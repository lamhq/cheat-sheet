# System Design

## Overview

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase.

The desired outcome is to come up with an architecture that achieves system design goals with acceptable tradeoffs.

> In System Design, there is no one correct solution for all questions, the most important thing is to make the right trade offs based on the given requirements.


## System Design Process

System design step-by-step process:

1. Ask Questions to capture:
   - Functional Requirements
   - Non-Functional Requirements
   - System Constraints
2. Define the System's API
3. Create a Software Architecture Diagram to fulfill the Functional
Requirements
4. Refine the Architecture Diagram to address the non-functional requirements
