# System Design Interview

## Overview

System design interviews can be intimidating due to their vague and broad nature. It could be as vague as "designing Youtube / Facebook?".

No one expects you to design a real-world system in an hour. The focus is on the design process, not the final design.

A system design interview lets you demonstrate your design skills, problem-solving, defend your choices, and respond to feedback, simulating real-life problem-solving and collaboration.


## Key Traits

What is an interviewer looking for in a system design interview?
- Technical design skills
- Ability to collaborate
- Handling pressure
- Resolving ambiguity constructively
- Asking good questions
- Red flags:
  - Over-engineering, which ignores tradeoffs and incurs high costs
  - Narrow-mindedness: unwillingness to accept or consider different opinions
  - Stubbornness: not changing one's attitude or position on something, even in the face of good reasons to do so


## Framework for System Design Interview

### 1. Understand the problem and establish design scope

Do not jump right in to give a solution.

Always ask for clarification.

Do not assume your assumption is correct.

Write down your assumptions on the whiteboard or paper.

Questions to ask:
- What type of application are we going to build? Web or mobile?
- What specific features are we going to build?
- How many users does the system have?
- What is the company's technology stack?
- What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?
- Required information for doing a **Back-of-the-envelope estimation**


### 2. Propose high-level design

Develop a high-level design and ask for feedback.

Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.

Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint fits the scale constraints.

If possible, go through a few concrete use cases. It's likely that the use cases would help you discover edge cases you have not yet considered.

Example:

To design a news feed system. At the high level, the design is divided into two flows:
- Feed publishing: when a user publishes a post, corresponding data is written into cache/database, and the post will be populated into friends' news feed.
- Newsfeed building: the news feed is built by aggregating friends' posts in a reverse chronological order.


### 3. Design deep dive

At this step, you and your interviewer should have already achieved the following objectives:
- Agreed on the overall goals and feature scope
- Sketched out a high-level blueprint for the overall design
- Obtained feedback from your interviewer on the high-level design
- Had some initial ideas about areas to focus on in deep dive based on her feedback

Dig into details of some system components. Design the most critical components first.
- For URL shortener, dive into the hash function design that converts a long URL to a short one.
- For a chat system, how to reduce latency and how to support online/offline status

Time management is essential. Try not to get into unnecessary details that do not demonstrate your abilities.

Draw a detailed design for the motst important use cases (features, flows).


### 4. Wrap up

Discuss other additional points:
- System bottlenecks and potential improvements. Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved. There is always something to improve upon. This is a great opportunity to show your critical thinking and leave a good final impression.
- Give the interviewer a recap of your design.
- Error cases (server failure, network loss, etc.) are interesting to talk about.
- Monitoring, logging, metrics, error notification
- How to scale the system?
- Propose other refinements you need if you had more time.


## Tips

Dos:
- Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct.
- Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.
- Suggest multiple approaches if possible.

Don'ts:
- Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions.
- Don't jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.
- Don't go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning. Give the high- level design first then drills down.
- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints.
- Don't think in silence. Remember, communicate.
- Don't think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often.


## Time allocation

With a 45-minute interview session, the rough estimation of the time you should spend on each step is:
1. Understand the problem and establish design scope: 3 - 10 minutes.
2. Propose high-level design and get buy-in: 10 - 15 minutes
3. Design deep dive: 10 - 25 minutes
4. Wrap: 10 - 15 minutes.
