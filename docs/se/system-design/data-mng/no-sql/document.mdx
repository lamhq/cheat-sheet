# Document Database

## Overview

Stores data in document format (e.g. JSON, BSON).

Each document is a self-contained and can have its own structure (flexible schema).

Good for hierarchical data, related data that is often embedded in a document to reduce the need for complex joins.

Use cases:
- Content Management System (CMS)
- Product Catalog
- User Profiles
