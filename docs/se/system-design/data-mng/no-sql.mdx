# NoSQL Database

## Overview

Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data with flexible schema.

Prioritize scalability, performance and availability.

Have different consistency models than ACID (e.g. BASE, Eventual Consistency, Soft state).

Store data in a non-relational format (e.g. JSON documents, key-value pairs).


## Use Cases

When to use NoSQL databases:

1. **Flexible Schema & Dynamic Data is Required**. Data structure evolves rapidly or varies significantly between items
2. **Specific Data Models are a Better Fit**. Document, Key-Value, Graph, or Columnar data naturally fits the problem
3. **High Scalability is a Primary Concern**. NoSQL databases are built for horizontal scaling, able to handle massive read/write volumes beyond what single relational servers can manage
4. **High Availability & Partition Tolerance are Critical**. Designed for distributed system that need to be online all the time
5. **Simplified Read/Write Patterns (Often No Joins)**. When your queries are simple and don't require complex joins.
