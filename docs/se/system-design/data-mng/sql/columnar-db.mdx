# Columnar Databases

## Overview

Columnar databases store data in columns instead of rows.

Columnar databases are designed for quickly processing and analyzing large amounts of data in columns. 

Modern Data Warehouses are built on columnar databases. OLAP applications leverage data warehouses to analyze data by focusing on specific columns and need efficient column-based reading from tables.

Available Data warehouse options include:
- AWS: RedShift
- Azure: Synapse
- Google Cloud: BigQuery
- Apache: Druid, Kudu, Pinot
- Others: ClickHouse, Snowflake
