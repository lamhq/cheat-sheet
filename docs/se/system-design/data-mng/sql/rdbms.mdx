# Relational Databases

## Overview

A relational database (RDBMS) is a type of database where:
- Data is stored in tables (like spreadsheets).
- Each row is a record (e.g., a product or a customer).
- Each column has a name, a data type (like text or number), and optional rules (called constraints).
- All records in a table share the same structure, known as the schema.
- Each record is uniquely identified by a primary key (one or more columns).

Characteristics:
- Use SQL to retrieve, update, analyze data.
- Optimized for [OLTP](../sql.mdx#OLTP) workloads.
- Guarantees [ACID properties](../transaction.mdx#ACID-properties) for transactions.
- Row-oriented.


## Advantages

- **Ability to form complex and flexible queries** using SQL
- **Efficient storage**. Ability to join multiple tables helps save a lot of space on storage
- **Easy to understand**. Table structure is natural for humans
- **ACID transaction guarantees**


## Disadvantages

1. **Rigid Schema Structure**
- Schema must be defined ahead, require **careful planning** during the design phase to avoid frequent schema changes.
- Changing the schema often requires maintenance downtime (table becomes temporarily unavailable).
2. **Hard to maintain/scale** because of their complexity
3. **Slower Read Performance** compared to non-relational databases


## Use Cases

Use RDBMS when:
1. **Complex Queries & Joins are Needed**. We want to perform complex and flexible queries to analyze data 
2. **Strong Data Consistency & ACID Compliance Required**. We need to guarantee ACID transactions between different entities in database
3. **Normalization is Important**. Reducing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity 
4. **Moderate or Predictable Workloads**. Relational database is a reliable choice for steady traffic, known access patterns, vertical scaling needs

When not to choose a RDBMS:
1. There isn't any inherent relationship between different records that justifies storing our data in tables
2. Read performance is the most important quality that we need (Big Data analytics)
