# Relational Databases (RDBMS)

## Overview

Stores data in structured tables with pre-defined schema (columns with specific data types).

Use SQL for data definition and manipulation.

Enforces relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.

Optimized for [OLTP](../sql.mdx#OLTP) workloads.

Guarantees [ACID properties](../transaction.mdx#ACID-properties) for transactions.

RDBMSs are row-oriented databases.

Excellent choice for **highly structured data**, **strong consistency**, and **complex relational queries**.

> [!NOTE]
> Traditional RDBMS cannot handle the massive scale needed for Big Data analytics.


## Options

Available RDBMSs options include:
- Cloud Agnostic: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
- AWS: Amazon RDS (hosted PostgreSQL and MySQL)
- Microsoft Azure: Azure SQL Database (hosted SQL Server)
- Google Cloud: Cloud SQL (hosted PostgreSQL and MySQL), Cloud Spanner


## When to use RDBMS?

1. **Strong Data Consistency & ACID Compliance Required**. Relational databases guarantee ACID properties for transactions.
2. **Data is Highly Structured & Predictable**. Well-defined schema, clear relationships, data doesn't change structure frequently
3. **Complex Queries & Joins are Needed**. Leveraging the power of SQL for reporting or data analysis across related tables
4. **Normalization is Important**. Reducing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity 
5. **Moderate or Predictable Workloads**. Relational database is a reliable choice for steady traffic, known access patterns, vertical scaling needs
