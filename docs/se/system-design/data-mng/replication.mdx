# Replication

## Overview

Replication is a process where data is duplicated and stored in multiple locations to ensure redundancy and reliability.

There's a primary database that only supports write operations. Secondary databases mirror the primary's dataset and only supports read operations.

## Failover

When one of the database servers goes offline:
- If a secondary database goes offline.
  - If there's no other secondary database, read operations will be directed to the primary database temporarily.
  - Otherwise, read operations are redirected to other healthy secondary databases.
- If the primary database goes offline, a secondary database will be promoted to be the new primary.

> [!CAUTION]
> In production systems, promoting a new primary is more complicated as the data in a secondary database might not be up to date. The missing data needs to be updated by running data recovery scripts.\
> Although some other replication methods like multi-primarys and circular replication could help, those setups are more complicated;


## Benefits

- **Better performance**. This allows more queries to be processed in parallel across secondary nodes
- **High availability**. If one of the replicas goes down, you can still access data stored in another replica.
- **Reliability**. Since data is replicated across multiple locations, when a disaster happens on one of the database servers, data is still preserved.


## Trade-Offs

- **Increased Complexity**:
  - Writes, updates, and deletes must be synchronized across replicas.
  - Ensuring data consistency and correctness becomes challenging.
- **Concurrency Issues**:
  - Simultaneous changes to the same data can cause conflicts.
  - Requires careful design to avoid data anomalies.
