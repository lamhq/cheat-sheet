# Sharding

## Overview

Sharding is a specific type of Horizontal Data Partitioning.

It divides a database into smaller, faster, manageable speicies called shards.

Each shard is a independent database instance that holds a subset of the data, but has the same schema.

A shard key is used to determine which shard stores a particular row of data.  

A routing mechanism (sharding logic) directs application queries to the appropriate shard.


## Benefits

1. **Enables horizontal scaling**: scale the data tier by adding more shard as data grow, overcomes single hardware limits.
2. **Provide High Availability**: Outages in one shard don’t affect the entire system.
3. **Improves query performance**:
   - Queries are faster since they only search a subset of data
   - Shard can be located closer to user in different regions
4. **Higher throughput**: Read/write operations scale better across multiple shards.


## Challenges

1. **Complex management**: Queries must be correctly routed to the right shard.
2. **Expensive operation**: Cross shard operations are expensive (e.g., joining)
3. **Data consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across shards can be challenging
4. **Merging shards is difficult**: If data distribution changes, rebalancing shards can be challenging.
5. **Poor sharding strategy can hurt performance**: Uneven distribution can overload some shards while others remain underutilized.


## Sharding strategies

### Geo-Based Sharding

Data is sharded based on geographical location, which can help reduce latency and comply with data residency regulations.

**Pros**:
- Reduces latency for geographically distributed users
- Helps with compliance
- Easy to add new shards

**Cons**:
- Uneven distribution - some shards may be too big to handle
- Is not approrpiate to some systems 

**Example**:

An e-commerce platform uses `country_code` as the sharding key to group user and order data by region:
- U.S. users are stored in the North America shard
- German users in Europe
- Japanese users in Asia-Pacific.

When a user from Japan logs in, the application routes the request to the Asia-Pacific shard. This shard handles all operations related to the user's data.


### Hash-Based Sharding

A hash function is applied to a sharding key (e.g., user ID) to determine the shard where the data should be stored. This ensures a more even distribution of data.

**Pros**:
- Provides a balanced distribution of data across shards
- Works well for key-value data

**Cons**:
- Adding new shards is difficult due to changing hash function require re-deploying the application
- Not a good solution if database grows quickly
- Weak consistency (no foreign keys)
- Can make range queries more complex and less efficient

**Example**:

Using the user ID to distribute user data across multiple servers.

There're 4 shards. The hash function is `user_id % 4`.

Anytime accessing the data, a hash function is used to find the corresponding shard:
- If the result equals to `0`, **shard 0** is used to store and fetch data
- If the result equals to `1`, **shard 1** is used
- The same logic applies to other shards.

### Range-Based Sharding

Data is divided into shards based on a specific range of values.

For example, you might shard data based on date ranges or alphabetical ranges.

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and understand.

**Cons**:
- Can lead to uneven data distribution if the data is not uniformly distributed.


### Directory-Based Sharding

A lookup table (directory) is used to map each piece of data to a specific shard. This allows for flexible and dynamic sharding.

**Pros**:
- Highly flexible and can adapt to changing data patterns.

**Cons**:
- The directory can become a single point of failure and may require additional maintenance.


### Composite Sharding

Combines multiple sharding strategies, such as range-based and hash-based sharding, to leverage the benefits of both.

**Pros**:
- Can handle complex and diverse data distribution requirements.

**Cons**:
- More complex to implement and manage.


## Sharding key

The most important factor to consider when implementing a sharding strategy is the choice of the sharding key (partition key).

Sharding key consists of one or more columns that determine how data is distributed.

When choosing a sharding key, one of the most important criteria is to choose a key that can evenly distributed data.


## Shard router

A shard router is a component in a sharded database. It acts as an intermediary between client applications and the sharded database, directing queries to the appropriate shard(s) based on the sharding key.

**Pros**:
- This helps simplify adding new shards, since we extract the logic of locating shards from the application to a separate service.

**Cons**:
- The shard router can become a single point of failure if not configured to be highly available.


## Celebrity problem (hotspot)

Hotspot occurs when a particular shard receives a disproportionately high amount of traffic compared to others.

This can lead to performance bottlenecks and uneven load distribution.

> 
> For example, imagine a social media platform where data for Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Lady Gaga all ends up on the same shard.   
> That shard becomes overwhelmed with read operations.  
> To solve this, we may need to allocate a separate shard for each celebrity. And depending on traffic, each shard might even need further partitioning.


## Resharding data

Resharding data is needed when a single shard could no longer hold more data due to rapid growth.

Certain shards might experience shard exhaustion faster than others due to uneven data distribution.

When shard exhaustion happens, it requires updating the sharding function and moving data around.

[Consistent hashing](./consistent-hashing.mdx) is a commonly used technique to solve this problem.


## De-normalization

Once a database has been sharded across multiple servers, it is hard to perform join operations across database shards.

A common workaround is to de-normalize the database so that queries can be performed in a single table.
