# Concurrency

Database concurrency refers to the management of simultaneous operations on a database without compromising data integrity.


## Isolation issues

These are potential problems that can occur when transactions are executed concurrently without sufficient isolation:

### Dirty Read

Occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction.

The data might be rolled back if the transaction fails, leading to potential inconsistencies.


### Non-Repeatable Read

Occurs when a second read of the same data retrieves different results because another transaction has modified the data in the meantime.


### Phantom Read

Occurs when a transaction re-executes a query and retrieves a different set of rows, because another transaction has inserted, updated, or deleted rows that meet the query criteria.

> [!NOTE]
> Phantom Read involves changes in the set of rows returned by a query (e.g., new rows added or deleted), while Non-Repeatable Read involves changes to the values of previously retrieved rows.


## Isolation Levels

Isolation levels define the degree to which a transaction remains separate from others, helping to maintain data consistency and integrity.

### Serializalble

Transactions are guaranteed to be executed in sequence.

This is the highest isolation level.


### Repeatable Read

Prevent changes to rows that have been read until the transaction is complete.


### Read Committed

Ensures that a transaction can only read committed data.

This prevent Dirty Reads but allowing Non-Repeatable Reads.


### Read Uncommitted

Allows transactions to read uncommitted data.

Dirty Reads can happen.

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non-repeatable | Phantom Read |
|------------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Serializable     | Impossible | Impossible     | Impossible   |
| Repeatable Read  | Impossible | Impossible     | Probably     |
| Read Committed   | Impossible | Probably       | Probably     |
| Read Uncommitted | Probably   | Probably       | Probably     |


## Locks

Locks are mechanisms used to manage concurrent access to data to ensure consistency and isolation.

They help prevent issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by controlling access to data during concurrent transactions.


### Shared Lock (S-Lock)

This lock allows multiple transactions to read a data item concurrently but prevents any transaction from writing to the data item while the lock is in place.

It's often used for read operations and ensures that no updates occur on the data item during the read, maintaining read integrity.

### Exclusive Lock (X-Lock)

Exclusive Lock allows only one transaction to read and write a data item.

It's typically used for write operations to ensure that no other transactions can access the data item until the lock is released (either by a commit or rollback).
