# High Availability

## Overview

High availability (HA) refers to a system's ability to operate continuously without significant downtime.

HA is a key requirement for critical systems where outages can lead to significant disruption or loss.

HA usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling, but not all the time.


## Key Concepts

### Uptime

This refers to the period during which a system is functioning and available.

HA strives to maximize uptime.

### Downtime

This is the period when a system is unavailable or not functioning as expected.

HA aims to minimize downtime.

### Redundancy

Redundancy involves duplicating critical system components.

If one component fails, another takes over.

### Failover

This is the automatic switching to a redundant system or component when a failure occurs.


## Techniques

Techniques for Achieving High Availability:

- Redundant Hardware: Duplicating servers, network devices, and other hardware components.
- Data Replication: Replicating data across multiple locations to ensure that it remains available even if one location fails.
- Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
- Failover Mechanisms: Automating the process of switching to redundant systems in the event of a failure.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitoring system health and alerting administrators to potential problems.
