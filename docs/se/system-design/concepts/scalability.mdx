# Scalability

## Overview

Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle an increasing workload or amount of work. It's about how well a system can adapt to growth.

Four axes of scaling:
- **Vertical scaling**: Getting a bigger machine.
- **Horizontal scaling**: having multiple things capable of doing the same work.
- **Data partitioning**: Dividing work based on some attribute of the data, e.g., customer group.
- **Functional decomposition**: Separation of work based on the type, e.g., microservice decomposition.


## Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling (aka **scaling up**), refers to increasing the capacity of a single machine (CPU, RAM, etc.) to handle more workload.

Implementation:
- Bare metal servers: purchasing new machines to upgrade
- Virtualized infrastructure: resize a VM or buy new hardware if the VM is already maxed out
- Cloud computing: cloud providers allow renting larger machines instantly

Benefits:
- Fast to implement (especially in the cloud).
- Minimal code changes—most applications can use the upgraded hardware without modification.
- Can support other scaling strategies (e.g., hosting multiple databases for microservices).

Use cases:
- Common for non distributed systems, such as database.
- When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option

Limitations:
- Hardware limit: There's usually a limit on how much you can vertically scale.
- Reliability: vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the system goes down with it completely.
- Cost: Larger machines are more expensive.


## Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling (aka **scaling out**) involves duplicating parts of a system to handle more workload.

Horizontal scaling adds more machines or instances and distributes the work among them.

Implementations:
- Load Balancing: Requests are distributed across multiple instances of a service.
- Competing Consumer Pattern: Multiple workers consume tasks from a queue.
- Read Replicas: Database replicas handle read requests, reducing load on the primary database.

Benefits:
- Scalability: Can handle increased workload by adding more instances.
- Minimal Code Changes: Often requires little or no modification to the application.
- Efficient Load Distribution: Helps reduce contention for computing resources.

Limitations:
- Cost: more machines lead to increasing costs.
- Complex load distribution: some systems need sticky sessions, which can limit scaling options
- Potential bottlenecks: bottlenecks may happen if the load distribution mechanism is misconfigured


## Data Partitioning

See [Database Partitioning](../data-mng/partitioning.mdx).


## Functional Decomposition

Functional decomposition is a scaling strategy where a system's functionality is split into smaller, independent components that can be scaled separately.

Functionalities are extracted into microservices. Each microservice can have its own infrastructure, database, and scaling strategy.

Implementation:
- Functional decomposition is often done by migrating to microservices (splitting the monolith).
- Each microservice can use different technologies optimized for its workload.

Benefits:
- Independent Scaling: Each microservice can be scaled separately.
- Optimized Infrastructure Costs: Small workloads can run on smaller machines, while high-load services get more resources.
- Flexibility in Technology Choices: Different microservices can use different programming languages or databases.
- Improved Organizational Scaling: Teams can own specific microservices, making development more efficient.
- Potential for Partial Failure Tolerance: If one microservice fails, the rest of the system can still function.
- Functional decomposition makes it easier to apply horizontal scaling and data partitioning.

Limitations:
- High Complexity: Splitting functionality requires significant changes to both frontend and backend.
- Increased Maintenance Effort: More microservices mean more components to manage.
- Data Migration Challenges: Moving data to separate microservices can be difficult.
- Not a Short-Term Solution: Functional decomposition takes time and effort to implement.


## Best practices

### Avoid Premature Optimization

Optimizing too early—before identifying real bottlenecks—can lead to wasted effort and unnecessary complexity.

Optimization should be driven by actual needs, not assumptions.


### Start Small

Avoid Unnecessary Complexity.

Decompose functionalities improves scalability, but also adds new infrastructure that must be managed.


### Experimentation is key

Confirm whether the proposed solution will work by conducting tests and experiments.

Example: If you suspect database queries are slowing down your system, run load tests to measure performance before deciding on partitioning or sharding.


### Combining Techniques

The best strategy involves combining multiple scaling techniques to optimize performance, reliability, and efficiency.

The goal isn't to scale in every possible way, but to choose the right combination based on system needs

Imagine an Order microservice in an e-commerce system.  

1️⃣ Step 1: Functional Decomposition  
- The Order functionality is extracted from the monolithic system into its own microservice.  
- This allows independent scaling of order processing.  

2️⃣ Step 2: Horizontal Duplication  
- Multiple copies of the Order microservice are deployed to handle increased traffic.  
- A load balancer distributes requests across these instances.  

3️⃣ Step 3: Geographic Sharding  
- Orders are sharded by region (e.g., US orders go to one shard, EU orders to another).  
- Within each region, horizontal duplication ensures redundancy and scalability.
