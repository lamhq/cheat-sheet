# Principles

System Design Principles.

## Why is it matter?

Software projects vary in complexity, and engineers often fall into the trap of overengineering (adding unnecessary layers, abstractions, or features).

Design principles act as a compass, helping teams stay focused on what's essential and avoid building bloated systems.


## KISS

*"Keep It Simple, Stupid"*. Aka, "Keep It Simple and Straightforward".

Simplicity is the primary goal. Avoid unnecessary complexity in design and implementation

Benefit: Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

How to apply:
- Use clear, meaningful names for components and methods.
- Maintain separation of concerns across layers and modules.
- Remove features that don't serve current requirements.

Ask yourself:
- Is this the simplest way to achieve this functionality?
- Is there any unnecessary complexity we can remove from our design?


## YAGNI

*"You Ain't Gonna Need It"*.

Don't implement functionality based on future speculation.

Benefit: Avoids wasted effort on features that may never be used.

How to apply:
- Build only what’s necessary to solve today’s problems.
- Do not add complexity for requirements that aren't actually present and clearly defined right now.

Ask yourself:
- Is it a concrete and current requirement? (if not, we won't build it)


## DRY

*"Don't Repeat Yourself"*.

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system (only exist once, no duplicates, no confusion).

Benefit: Promotes maintainability, reduces errors and minimizes complexity

How to apply:
- Centralize logic, configuration, and design elements.
- Refactor repeated code into reusable functions or modules.

Ask yourself:
- Are there any duplicated logic or core functionalities across different modules?
