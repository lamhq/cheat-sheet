# CQRS

## Overview

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a data store into distinct models.

Useful in applications with high read-to-write ratios.

When combined with event sourcing, CQRS can provide a powerful way to handle complex state changes and maintain a complete history of changes to the data


## Separation of Models

Instead of using a single data model for both reading and writing, CQRS recommends having separate models.

The command model is optimized for handling write operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

The query model is designed for efficient data retrieval and is optimized for read operations.


## Command and Query Paths

The application's code is divided into two distinct paths
- The Command Path handles write operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting data
- The Query Path handles read operations and is optimized for querying and displaying data to users


## Eventually consistent

Due to the asynchronous nature of write operations and the use of separate models, it is common for data in the query store to lag behind recent updates.

Some ways to address this:
- Inform the user that changes might take some time to appear.
- Apply the user's changes within the local application even if they are not yet reflected in the query store.

> For example, after a user has added a comment to a conversation, the comment appears in their local browser/app even if it hasn't yet been handled by the command processor on the server (and thus isn't visible to anyone else).


## Benefits

Read and write operations can be optimized independently.

Read and write workloads can be scaled independently.


## Disdvantages

- Eventually consistent: delay between updated being reflected.
- System become more complicated. More things could go wrong.


## When to use?

- When your application has complex business logic and validation rules for writes, and different read models for various queries.
- If your read and write workloads have different scaling needs.
- When you need to optimize performance for both reads and writes.
- If you need to minimize conflicts and improve performance by separating the concerns of reading and writing data.
