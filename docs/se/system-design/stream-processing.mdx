# Stream Processing

## Overview

In today's systems, we often deal with infinite streams of events:
- sensor data from IoT devices
- payment notifications from credit card companies
- user activity in web applications

In many cases, to get meaningful insights, we need to aggregate and analyze a series of events instead of processing each event in isolation:
- pattern recognition
- rate limiting
- recommendation service

Analyzing an infinite stream of data is impossible. Instead, we breaks the stream into finite windows (e.g., 5-minute chunks).

Windows strategies for processing streams of events:
