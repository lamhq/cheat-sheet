# Stream Processing

## Introduction

In today's systems, we often deal with infinite streams of events:
- sensor data from IoT devices
- payment notifications from credit card companies
- user activity in web applications

In many cases, to get meaningful insights, we need to aggregate and analyze a series of events instead of processing each event in isolation:
- pattern recognition
- rate limiting
- recommendation service

Analyzing an infinite stream of data is impossible. Instead, we breaks the stream into finite windows (e.g., 5-minute chunks).

Windows strategies for processing streams of events:
- Tumbling Window
- Hopping Window
- Sliding Window
- Session Window


## Event Time

For every event we can define three distinct timestamps:
- Event Time
- Arrival Time
- Processing Time

The timestamp to use to match events into windows depends on the use case.

### Event Time

- The moment the event actually occurred.
- Embedded in the event’s payload.
- Example: When a sensor captures temperature or location data.

Use when:
- You need precise timing for analysis or decision-making.
- Events may arrive late or out of order.
- The actual occurrence time is more meaningful than when the system receives it.

Examples:
- Stock market analysis (trade events)
- User activity analytics (in mobile apps, web)


### Arrival Time

- When the event reaches the system or microservice.
- Always later than the event time due to network delays, system load, or processing type (real-time vs batch).

Use when:
- Real-time actions like monitoring or alerting require immediate response (e.g., a rate-limiting service).
- Event time is unavailable or unreliable.
- The exact timing of the original event isn’t critical to your logic.

### Processing Time
- When the event is actually handled by the application code.
- Usually very close to arrival time, unless the system is overloaded.


## Handling Late Events

Sometimes an event arrives after its window has closed, normally it will be discarded.

To avoid losing valuable data, we add extra time (grace period) **after** the window ends and **before** finalizing results (performing the aggregation of events, publishing the results, and discarding the window).

Late events that arrive within this grace period are still included.

Once the grace period ends, the window is permanently closed and any further late events are discarded.


### Watermark

Grace Periods are too long can add unnecessary delay. But 
too short can likely to lose valid events.

To solve that we introduce a value called a watermark.

A **watermark** is a threshold used to decide when to close a window based on event time, not arrival time.

The system tracks the maximum event time seen so far.

A window stays open as long as:

```
max event time - watermark < window end time
```

Late events are accepted if their event time fits within this condition—even if they arrive much later.

**Example**:

- Watermark = 10s, max event time = 00:59.
- A late event with event time 00:57 still fits and is added to the old window.
- Arrival time doesn’t matter.
- Once an event arrives that pushes the condition beyond the window’s end, the window closes and results are published.

**Pros**:

- No need for a fixed grace period.
- More flexible handling of out-of-order events.

**Cons**:

- Window closing time becomes unpredictable.
- May delay result publication longer than expected.


## Technologies

Event Stream Processing Technologies:

### Apache Kafka Streams

Client library (Java and Scala) for building applications and microservices that process continuous streams of records coming through the Kafka message broker.

It supports:
- Per record, real-time processing
- Stateful and processing using Windows Strategies (Tumbling, Hopping, Sliding, Session)


### Apache Flink

Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for building scalable streaming ETL, analytics, and event-driven applications. 

It is specifically designed for stateful computations of bounded and unbounded streams of events.

Apache Flink can:
- Be used as a distributed system that requires effective allocation and management of computing resources using Hadoop YARN or Kubernetes.
- Run as a standalone distributed cluster
- Used as a client library for building microservices

### Azure Stream Analytics

Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics service that enables you to process and analyze streaming data from various sources.

It's a fully managed, serverless service that uses a SQL-like query language to process data streams using windows.

Support Windows Strategies (Tumbling, Hopping, Sliding, Session).
