# System Requirements

System requirements are a formal way of identifying what needs to be built for a client.

## Gathering Requirements

### Challenges

Challenges of gathering requirements:
1. **Big Scope and High Level of Abstraction**
   - As abstraction increases from methods, classes to modules, libraries, applications, so do the number of possible solutions.
   - This can be overwhelming because it's hard for us to visualize the implementation.
2. **High Level of Ambiguity**
   - Requirements often come from non-technical stakeholders (e.g., clients or product managers). These are usually high-level and vague.
   - Sometimes, even the client doesn’t know exactly what they need.
   - Engineers must translate vague ideas into technical specifications

### Importance

Getting the requirements right upfront is absolutely critical because:
- Large scale systems are big projects that cannot be easily changed, they typically involve contracts with time commitments and financial obligations.
- Not delivering the product to our clients on time may cause irreversible damage to our company's reputation and brand image


## Types of Requirements

Three main types of software requirements:
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- System Constraints

They are called **architectural drivers** because they guide the design from countless possibilities to a solution that meets the client's needs.


## Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements define what the system does (its behavior and capabilities).

They don’t determine system architecture. Generally any architecture can achieve any feature.

Examples:
- When a rider logs in, the app shows nearby drivers within a 5-mile radius.
- After a ride ends, the system charges the rider and pays the driver (minus fees).

Formal method of gathering functional requirements:

1. Identify all the actors/users in our system
2. Capture and describe all the possible **use-cases**/scenarios
3. Expand each use case through **flow of events** (using Sequence Diagram). In each event, capture the actions and take note of the data that flows with it to and from the system.


## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (aka Quality Attributes) describe how well the system performs on a particular dimension (rather than what it does).

They have a direct effect on the software architecture. And different architectures provide us with different quality attributes.

Some of Quality Attributes:
- **Scalability**: Can handle growing user base.
- **Availability**: System is accessible when needed.
- **Reliability**: Performs consistently without failure.
- **Security**: Protects user data and transactions.
- **Performance**: Responds quickly and efficiently.

There're some some very important considerations about quality attributes when it comes to designing a software system:

### Testability & Measurability

Quality attributes need to be **measurable** and **testable**.

If we cannot prove that our system satisfied the required quality attributes we don't know if our system performs well or poorly


### Tradeoffs

No single software architecture can provide all the quality attributes, because:
- Certain quality attributes contradict one another
- Some combinations of quality attributes are very hard / impossible to achieve

Software Architects need to make the right tradeoff, prioritizing some quality attributes over the others, and designing the system in a way that will give us the highest chance for success based on the requirements of the business.


### Feasibility

We need to make sure that the system is capable of delivering with the client asking for.

The client may ask for something that is either Technically impossible or Prohibitively expensive to implement.

It's system designer's job to call that out early on in the process.


## System Constraints

When defining architecture, we face many design choices to meet quality and functionality goals. System constraints are pre-set decisions that limit our options and guide the design process.

System constraints provide us with a solid starting point. They are usually non-negotiable, we need to design the rest of the system around those constraints. They are referred as pillars for software architecture.

There are three types of constraints:

### Technical constraints

they affect the decisions we make in the design phase and put restrictions on our architecture

Examples: 
- Being locked to a particular hardware/cloud vendor (e.g., AWS, on-premise)
- Having to use a particular programming language
- Having to use a particular database or technology
- Having to support certain platforms, browsers, or OS

### Business constraints

Limited budget or a strict deadline will make us have very different choices than if we had an unlimited budget and unlimited time.

Certain software architectural patterns are more suitable for small startups, and there're other patterns fit much better with bigger organizations.

Some business constraints require to use third-party services with their own architecture as a part of our system (shipping, payment processing, banks, brokers,etc).


### Legal constraints

Those constraints may be global or specific to a particular geographical region.

Examples:
- In the US, if you are developing a system that handles medical information or patient's records, you need to adhere to the HIPAA regulations that place certain constraints on accessing the patient's data
- In the European Union, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) sets limitations on collecting, storing and sharing users' data

We shouldn't take any given constraint lightly. There're real constraints that there is nothing we can do about and self-imposed constraints that we can negotiate and maybe even remove.

We need to design our architecture to be loosely coupled with the constraints we take on. For example:
- If limited to a database/third-party service, we need to make sure our system is not tightly coupled to that technology or APls
- Usage of different technology/service in future should need minimal changes
- Different parts of the system can be decoupled to be easily replaced or updated independently
