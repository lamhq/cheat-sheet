  - 1M chat sessions
- How many messages per day?
  - 1 Billion

How it work?
1. We have a mobile device and a list of friends
2. We pick one friend from the list and start sending messages
3. If our friends have chat open at the moment, they can see the messages are sent to them
4. If the chat is closed, they won't be notified
