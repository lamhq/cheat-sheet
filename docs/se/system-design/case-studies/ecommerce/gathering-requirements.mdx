# Gathering Requirements

There're two actors in the system: **Merchants** and **Buyers**.

## Merchants

1. **Product Type**: Are we dealing with digital products like ebooks or music, or with physical products that have fixed inventory?
2. **Data Requirements**: What information do merchants need to provide when onboarding a new product?
3. **Analytics**: What kind of data should we provide to merchants about their product sales?
4. **Product Management Operations**: What operations should merchants be able to perform on existing products (e.g., update, delete, etc.)?


## Buyers

1. **Purchase**: Can anyone browse and purchase products, or do users need to register?
2. **Review**: Should we design a system for product reviews and ratings?
3. **Search**: What capabilities should buyers have for searching products?
4. **Checkout**: What parts of the checkout process need to be designed?
5. **Platform**: Should the platform only support a web interface, or a mobile experience as well?
