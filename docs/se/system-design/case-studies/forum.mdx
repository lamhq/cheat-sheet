# Discussion Forum

## Overview

Design and architect a highly scalable public discussion forum (Reddit, Quora, Stack Overflow, etc.), where people can:
- post questions or news
- comment on existing posts
- upvote or downvote posts or comments
- get a feed of the most popular posts


## Functional Requirements

1. A user can signup and login to post, vote, or comment.
2. A user should be able to create a new post that contains a
   - Title
   - Topic tags
   - Body (text or uploaded images)
3. A user should be able to comment on any existing post.
4. Comments are ordered chronologically as a flat list.
5. User can to delete their own post or comment
6. Logged-in user can upvote/downvote an existing post/comment.
7. Present the top most popular posts in the last 24 hours on the homepages
8. Popularity = Upvotes - Downvotes (for posts happened in the last 24 hours)

Example questions that capture the functional requirements:

- Can anyone post or view posts/comments?
- What can a post contain? (text/images/video)
- What is the meaning of "most popular posts"?
- What is the structure of comments? (flat list vs tree)


## Non-functional requirements

1. **Scalability**: millions of daily users
2. **Performance**: Less than 500 ms Response Time
3. **Fault Tolerance & High Availability**: 99.9%
4. **Availability + Partition Tolerance**: prefer AP over CP. It's okay if users see slightly outdated data, as long as the system stays responsive and reliable.
5. **Durability**: Data such as users, posts, comments, and votes must be safely stored and never lostâ€”unless intentionally deleted.
