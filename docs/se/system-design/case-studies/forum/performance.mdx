# Performance

## Object Store

Every time a user views popular posts, the system must load associated images from a central object store.

To reduce latency when loading images, use a CDN service to distribute images to edge servers (close to users geographically).

The CDN service can also deliver static content for the Web App Service which speeds up page load times for users.


## API Gateway

At the API gateway, we can cache responses of frequently viewed posts during peak times, refreshing every few minutes.

This improves performance and availability.


## Database

Add index to tables to speed up queries for every GET request. For example, getting comments for a post.
