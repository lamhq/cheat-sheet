# Availability

## Database

1. Introduce **database replication** for failover in case a database instance or database shard crashes.
2. Take regular **backups** to prevent data loss.


## Multi-datacenter Deployment

Deploy system across multiple data centers in different geographical locations and utilize a global load balancing service for failover to another region if there is a natural disaster in one of those regions.

> [!NOTE]
> This also improves **performance** as the system gets physically closer to users on different continents.
