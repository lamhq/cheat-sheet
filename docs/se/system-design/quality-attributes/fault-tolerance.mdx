# Fault Tolerance

## Overview

Failures are inevitable in any system.

Fault Tolerance enables our system to remain operational and available to the users despite failures within one or multiple of its components.

When failures happen a fault-tolerant system will:
- Continue operating at the same/reduced level of performance
- Prevent the system from becoming unavailable

Fault Tolerance is the best way to achieve High Availability.

Fault Tolerance revolves around 3 major tactics:
- Failure Prevention
- Failure Detection and Isolation
- Recovery

> ![INFO]
> Key point: system continue operating normally (you don’t feel the failure at all) even when one or more components fail.


## Failure Prevention

To prevent the system from going down, we need to eliminate any Single Point of Failure (SPoF) in the system

> [!INFO]
> 
> SPoF can be:
> - Running our application on one server
> - Storing all data of database on a single computer

The best way to eliminate SPoF is through **Replication** and **Redundancy**:
- **Database Replication**: Running replicas of database containing the same data on multiple servers. Losing any of those replicas will not cause losing data.
- **Spatial Redundancy**: Running multiple instances of our application on different servers. If one server goes down, direct network traffic to the other servers instead.
- **Time Redundancy**: Repeating the same operation/request multiple times until we succeed/give up

Two strategies for Redundancy & Replication:
- Active-Active Architecture
- Active-Passive Architecture

### Active-Active

All replicas (copies of the system or database) are active and handle requests simultaneously.

**Benefits**:
- **High availability**: If one replica fails, others can instantly take over.
- **Horizontal scalability**: Load is distributed across all replicas, improving performance.

**Challenges**:
- **Synchronization overhead**: All replicas must stay in sync, which requires complex coordination and can introduce latency or consistency issues.


### Active-Passive

One primary replica handles all requests, while passive replicas stay updated by periodically syncing with the primary.

**Benefits**:
- **Simpler implementation**: Easier to manage since there's a clear leader and followers.
- **Reliable failover**: If the primary fails, a passive replica can be promoted to take over.

**Limitations**:
- **Limited scalability**: All traffic goes to one machine, which can become a bottleneck.


## Failure Detection & Isolation

Detect faulty instances and stop routing requests to them.

To achieve this, systems rely on the monitoring service that continuously check the health of each instance.

Common monitoring methods are:
- **Health Checks**: The monitoring service sends periodic requests (pings) to each instance. If an instance fails to respond within a set time, it's marked as unhealthy.
- **Heartbeats**: Each healthy instance sends regular heartbeat signals to the monitoring service. If a heartbeat is missed for a certain duration, the instance is assumed to be down.

Beyond basic pings and heartbeats, monitoring systems can use more sophisticated metrics:
- **Error Rate**: If a server logs an unusually high number of exceptions or errors, it may be failing.
- **Response Time**: If a server becomes significantly slower, it may be degraded or overloaded.

It's important to avoid **False Negative** where a failed server is not detected that it may continue receiving traffic and cause errors.


## Recovery from Failure

Regardless of system failure rate, if we can detect and recover from each failure faster than user can notice, then our system will have high availability.

Actions to take after detecting faulty instance:
1. **Stop routing traffic** to that host
2. **Restart the host** to make the problem go away
   - Assumes the issue may be transient
   - Often effective for short-lived failures.
3. **Rollback** to a stable version
   - Database rollback: when we get to a state violating some condition/data, we can roll back to the last correct state
   - Software rollback: If a new version causes errors, we can roll back to the previous version
