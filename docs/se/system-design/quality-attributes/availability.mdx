# Availability

## Overview

Availability is the system's ability to operate continuously without significant downtime.


## Formulars

Availability is defined as the fraction of time/probability that our service is operationally functional and accessible to the user:

**Availability (%) = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)**

- Uptime: The time that our system is operationally functional and accessible to the user
- Downtime: The time that our system is unavailable to the user

---

Availability can also be defined as:

**Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)**

- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): the average time our system is operational
- MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): the average downtime of the system (to detect & recover from a failure)

This formula is more statistical and more useful for availability estimation rather than measurement.


## How much is High Availability?

Availability is measured as a percentage.

100% means a service that has 0 downtime.

Industry standard (set by cloud vendors) is typically 99.9% or higher.

List of availability numbers and expected downtime:

| Availability | Daily Downtime | Weekly Downtime | Monthly Downtime | Annual Downtime |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 90%          | 2h 24m       | 16h 48m       | 3d              | 36d 12h       |
| 95%          | 1h 12m       | 8h 24m        | 1d 12h         | 18d 6h        |
| 99%          | 14m 24s      | 1h 40m 48s   | 7h 18m         | 3d 15h 36m   |
| 99.9%        | 1m 26s       | 10m 5s        | 43m 12s        | 8h 45m 36Ã¥s   |

Availability is often described by the number of nines in its digits. The more the nines, the better:
- 99.9% = 3 nines
- 99.99% = 4 nines
- 99.999% = 5 nines


## Techniques

Techniques for achieving High Availability:

- Redundant Hardware: Duplicating servers, network devices, and other hardware components.
- Data Replication: Replicating data across multiple locations to ensure that it remains available even if one location fails.
- Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
- Failover Mechanisms: Automating the process of switching to redundant systems in the event of a failure.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitoring system health and alerting administrators to potential problems.
