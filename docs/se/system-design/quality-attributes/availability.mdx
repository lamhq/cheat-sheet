# Availability

## Overview

Availability refers to a system's ability to operate continuously without significant downtime.

Availability is defined as the fraction of time/probability that our service is operationally functional and accessible to the user:

**Availability (%) = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)**

- Uptime: The time that our system is operationally functional and accessible to the user
- Downtime: The time that our system is unavailable to the user

---

Availability can also be defined as:

**Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)**

- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): the average time our system is operational
- MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): the average downtime of the system (to detect & recover from a failure)

This formula is more statistical and more useful for availability estimation rather than measurement.


## How much is High Availability?

Users would want 100% availability.

On the engineering side it is:
- Extremely hard to achieve
- Leaves no time for maintenance/upgrades

Some examples of Availability value:

| Availability | Daily Downtime | Weekly Downtime | Monthly Downtime | Annual Downtime |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 90%          | 2 h 24 m       | 16 h 48 m       | 3 d              | 36 d 12 h       |
| 95%          | 1 h 12 m       | 8 h 24 m        | 1 d 12 h         | 18 d 6 h        |
| 99%          | 14 m 24 s      | 1 h 40 m 48 s   | 7 h 18 m         | 3 d 15 h 36 m   |
| 99.9%        | 1 m 26 s       | 10 m 5 s        | 43 m 12 s        | 8 h 45 m 36 s   |

Industry standard set by cloud vendors is typically 99.9% or higher.

Availability is typically expressed as a percentage, and is often described by the number of nines in its digits:
- 99.9% = 3 nines
- 99.99% = 4 nines
- 99.999% = 5 nines


## Techniques

Techniques for achieving High Availability:

- Redundant Hardware: Duplicating servers, network devices, and other hardware components.
- Data Replication: Replicating data across multiple locations to ensure that it remains available even if one location fails.
- Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
- Failover Mechanisms: Automating the process of switching to redundant systems in the event of a failure.
- Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitoring system health and alerting administrators to potential problems.
