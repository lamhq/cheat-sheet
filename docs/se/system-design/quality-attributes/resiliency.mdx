# Resiliency

## Overview

Resilience refers to the ability of a system to withstand failures and recover gracefully without causing major disruptions to the overall application.

A system is considered to be resilient if it can continue to function effectively despite failures or disruptions.

This's important because in a distributed architecture, failures are inevitable due to network issues, service crashes, or hardware faults.

## Key Principles

- **Design for failure**: Assume things will go wrong and plan accordingly.
- **Graceful degradation**: If one service fails, others should still work.
- **Fault tolerance**: The system should continue operating even when parts of it fail.
- **Self-healing**: Services should restart or reroute automatically when issues occur.
- **Isolation**: Prevent cascading failures by isolating services (e.g., using bulkheads or circuit breakers).
