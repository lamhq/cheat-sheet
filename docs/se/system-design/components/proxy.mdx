A forward proxy is an intermediary server that sits between client devices and the internet, handling requests on behalf of users.

Forward proxies protects clients.

Key Features:

- **Privacy:** Masks the client's IP address, helping users access restricted content.
- **Security Filtering:** Blocks malicious sites and enforces access policies.
- **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed content to improve performance.
- **Traffic Control:** Helps manage bandwidth usage and optimize network efficiency.

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend service.

Reverse proxies are used to protect the serverâ€™s identity and hide its internal structure.

Reverse proxies benefit backend servers by improving:
- security (content filtering, SSL encryption)
- load balancing (distribute traffic across multiple servers)
- caching
- performance

Reverse proxies are commonly used in large-scale web applications and content delivery networks (CDNs).
