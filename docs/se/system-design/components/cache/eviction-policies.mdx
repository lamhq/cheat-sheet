# Eviction Policies

## Overview

A cache eviction policy is an algorithm that determines which data items should be removed from the cache when it becomes full.

The goal is to maximize the cache hit rate while minimizing the number of cache misses.


## Least Recently Used (LRU)

Removes the least recently accessed items first.

Most caches use LRU as the default.

Implementation:
- LRU is based on a linked list where the head points to the next item to be removed.
- When there is a cache hit, the item moves to the tail of the list.
- If the element is not in the list (cache miss), it's added to the tail of the list and pushes one element out.

Pros:
- Fast algorithm that is simple to implement
- Work well in many real-world scenarios

Cons:
- If a lot of new keys are requested, it may evict popular keys


## Least Frequently Used (LFU)

Removes the items that are accessed the least frequently.

Implementation:
- Every key have a counter
- Every time an element is accessed (cache hit), the counter is incremented
- In case of cache miss, key with the lowest counter value is evicted

Pros:
- The most valuable data is readily available
- Provide stable performance in scenarios where the access frequency of items does not change drastically

Cons:
- Overhead of keeping track of the counters for each key
- Items that were frequently accessed in the past but are no longer relevant can remain in the cache, leading to suboptimal performance

Compare with LRU:
- LRU is faster and cheaper in terms of memory than LFU.
- LFU suffers less from false cache eviction


## First In, First Out (FIFO)

Removes the oldest items first, regardless of how often they were accessed.


## Most Recently Used (MRU)

Removes the most recently accessed items first.
