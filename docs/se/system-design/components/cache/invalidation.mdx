# Invalidation

## Overview

Cache invalidation is the process of removing outdated data from a cache to ensure freshness and accuracy.

Why does it matter?
- Cached data can become stale if the original data changes.
- Using outdated data can lead to inconsistencies in a system.
- The challenge is deciding when and how to remove cached data.


## Time to Live (TTL)

TTL (Time to Live) is a cache invalidation mechanism, it ensures that cached data remains valid for a fixed duration, after which it is considered stale and must be refreshed.

How it Works?
- Each cache entry is assigned a TTL duration (e.g., 5 minutes).
- During this period, the cache serves the stored data.
- Once the TTL expires, the cache invalidates the entry and fetches a fresh copy from the origin service.

Forms of TTL:
- Fixed TTL: A expiration duration for all cached entries.
- Timestamp-based expiration: Entries expire at a specific timestamp.
- Dynamic TTL: TTL varies based on data characteristics (e.g., fast-selling items have shorter TTLs, slow-moving items have longer TTLs).

Advantages:
- Simple to implement (no complex invalidation logic).
- Works well for predictable data refresh cycles.

Challenges:
- Inflexible. TTL does not react to real-time data changes.
- Stale data can exists if the origin updates right after a TTL refresh, the cache remains outdated until the next cycle.

> [!NOTE]
> HTTP provides the ability to specify `Cache-Control` (how long clients should consider data fresh) and `Expires headers` (an explicit expiration timestamp for cached responses) on responses to enable smarter client-side caching.


## Conditional GETs (HTTP)

Conditional GET requests are an efficient way to check if cached data is still valid before fetching a new copy. They help reduce unnecessary data transfers and expensive resource regeneration.

How it Work?
1. HTTP provides `ETags` (Entity Tags), which act as unique identifiers for a resource.
2. When a client fetches a resource, the server includes an `ETag` in the response.
3. Later, when the client wants to refresh the resource, it sends a conditional GET request with the header: `If-None-Match: <ETag>`
4. The server checks if the resource has changed:
   - If unchanged, it responds with 304 Not Modified (no need to resend the data).
   - If changed, it responds with 200 OK and the updated resource.

Benefits:
- Reduces unnecessary data transfers (avoids fetching unchanged resources).
- Prevents expensive resource regeneration (avoids redundant database queries).
- Improves efficiency in systems where data changes infrequently.

Limitations:
- Still requires a network request (does not eliminate round trips).
- Not useful for reducing latency (client still contacts the server).


## Notification-Based

Notification-based invalidation uses events to inform subscribers when their cached data is outdated.

**How it Works?**
- The origin emits an event when data changes.
- Subscribers listen for these events.
- When an event is received, the subscriber invalidates its cache and updates it with fresh data.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces stale data window: cache updates as soon as a change occurs.
- Efficient for real-time updates
- Works well with pub/sub messaging systems

**Challenges**:
- Infrastructure complexity: requires event-driven architecture.
- Reliability risk: if notifications fail, caches may not update (better to have heartbeat events to confirm the system is still active).

**Where to use it?**
- When real-time accuracy is critical (e.g., stock levels, pricing updates).
- When a message broker is already in use for microservice communication.
- When TTL-based invalidation is too slow for dynamic data changes.

The notification event should contain ID of the changed item and its new data to allow direct cache update without fetching new data.
