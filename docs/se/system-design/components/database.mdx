# Database

## Components

Databases have 5 components

- API: defines a language or API to interact with the database. It covers definition, manipulation, query, and control of data and transactions.
- Query Processor: process incoming requests, perform needed actions, and return results.
- Storage: The disk or memory where the data is stored.
- Indexes: Data structures to quickly locate the queried data in the storage.
- Metadata: Meta-information of data, storage. and indexes (e.g., catalog, schema, size).

### Query Processor

The Query Processor performs the following steps for each incoming request:
- Parses the request and validates it against the metadata.
- Creates an efficient execution plan that exploits the indexes.
- Reads or updates the storage.
- Updates metadata and indexes.
- Computes and returns results.


## Blob Storage

Blob Storage (Binary Large OBjects) is used to store unstructured data.

Blob supports CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations at the file level.

Documents, images, audio, and video files are stored in blobs.

Directory/file path is used to quickly locate the file. Locating something within a file requires a sequential scan.
