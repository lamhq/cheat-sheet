# API Gateway

## Introduction

An API Gateway is a service that sits in between the client and the collection of backend services.

Instead of clients calling multiple services directly, they send one request to the API Gateway, which then handles everything behind the scenes.

The API Gateway uses the API composition pattern to compose multiple service APIs into a single unified API, allowing clients to send requests to just one endpoint.


## Benefits

1. **Making Seamless Internal Changes**. Enable modifying backend services without affecting external clients.
2. **Centralized Security**. Consolidate **authentication**, **authorization**, **rate limiting**, **SSL termination** in one place.
3. Enables **request routing**: clients send one request, and the gateway distributes it to multiple services and aggregates the responses.
4. **Static content & Response Caching**: Frequently requested data can be served instantly without hitting backend services.
5. **Monitoring & Alerting**.
   - Get real time metrics about traffic patterns and system load.
   - Triggers alerts for unusual spikes or drops in traffic.
6. **Protocol Translation**. Converts between external and internal protocols (REST JSON to RPC or XML).


## Best Practices

1. **API Gateway shouldn't contain any business logic**. It should focus on **routing**, **security**, **monitoring**, and **composition**.
2. **Avoid Single Point of Failure**. Since all traffic flows through the API Gateway, it must be **highly available**.
3. **Prevent clients bypassing the gateway**. All external calls should go through the API Gateway.
