# Message Brokers

## Overview

A message broker acts as an intermediary that facilitates communication between different applications, systems, or services.

A message is a generic concept that defines the thing that a message broker sends. A message could contain a request, a response, or an event.

Message brokers facilitate asynchronous communication between microservices. Instead of directly interacting with another microservice, a microservice sends a message to the message broker, it then delivery the message to the appropriate consumer.

Brokers may provide **queues** and **topics**.

Popular message brokers:
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- ActiveMQ
- Amazon SNS, EventBridge
- Kinesis (AWS)


## Consumers

Consumers are entities that receive and process messages sent by a producer via the message broker.

Each instance of a microservice can be a consumer.

Multiple instances of the same microservice form a consumer group.


## Queues

A queue is a data structure used by message brokers to store messages.

Queues are typically point to point:
1. A sender puts a message on a queue, and a consumer reads from that queue.
2. The queue acts as an intermediary, ensuring that each message is consumed by only one consumer.
3. Once a consumer receives and processes the message, it is removed from the queue.

When a message is put into the queue, only one member of the consumer group will receive that message; the queue works as a load distribution mechanism.

Example: RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS.


## Topics

Topics are channels where messages are published by producers.

Multiple consumers can subscribe to a topic and receive a copy of every message published to it.

If multiple consumer groups subscribe to a topic, within each consumer group, only one instance will see that message.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike queues, topics allow broadcasting messages to all subscribers rather than delivering messages to just one consumer.


## Benefits

Message brokers provide capabilities that can be useful for asynchronous communication:
1. **Guaranteed Delivery**: Brokers ensure messages are reliably delivered to their destination, even if the downstream service is temporarily unavailable. They store messages in a durable manner until they can be processed.
1. **Message Order Guarantee**: Most brokers ensures that messages are delivered in the same order they were sent.
2. **Transactions on Write**: allow to write data to multiple topics in a single transactionn (e.g., Kafka).
3. **Read Transactionality**: prevents message loss in case the consumer fail to process it.
4. **Exactly-Once Delivery**: Guarantees that messages are delivered only once without duplication.

> [!CAUTION]
> While brokers may guarantee exactly once delivery, it is still recommended to design consumers to gracefully handle potential duplicate messages.
