# Data centers

## Overview

Data center are facilities used to house computer systems and associated components. They typically include servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and various security devices.

When an application is accessed internationally, to improve availability and provide a better user experience across wider geographical areas, supporting multiple data centers is crucial.

With many data centers in different regions, requests are geo-routed based on user's IP address. This allow domain names to be resolved to IP addresses based on the location of a user.

In the event of any significant data center outage, we direct all traffic to a healthy data center.


## Challenges

Several technical challenges must be resolved to achieve multi-data center setup:

**Traffic redirection**: traffic need to be direct to the correct data center. GeoDNS can be used to direct traffic to the nearest data center depending on where a user is located.

**Data synchronization**: Users from different regions could use different local databases or caches. In failover cases, traffic might be routed to a data center where data is unavailable. A common strategy is to replicate data across multiple data centers.

**Test and deployment**: With multi-data center setup, it is important to test your website/application at different locations. Automated deployment tools are vital to keep services consistent through all the data centers
