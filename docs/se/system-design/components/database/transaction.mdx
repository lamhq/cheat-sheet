# Transaction

## Overview

A database transaction is a sequence of one or more operations performed on database data.

It is treated as a single, indivisible unit, ensuring that either all operations within it are successfully completed, or none are. 

Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time).

Transactions adhere to the ACID properties to maintain integrity in the database system.


## ACID properties

These properties are designed to ensure that database transactions are processed reliably.

- **Atomicity**: This property ensures that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit, which either completely succeeds or fails.
- **Consistency**: A transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent execution of multiple transactions leaves the database in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially.
- **Durability**: Committed transactions are permanent, and survive even a system crash.


## Transactional databases

Transactional databases are systems that support database transactions with ACID properties.

They ensure data integrity, consistency, and reliability, especially in environments with high volumes of concurrent operations.

Most SQL databases support transactions.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.


## Distributed Transactions

Distributed transactions are operations that span multiple databases or systems.

They follow ACID properties, ensure all parts of a transaction succeed or fail together, maintaining data consistency.
 
A distributed transaction might include systems:
- databases
- storage managers
- file systems
- messaging systems
- other data managers...

DBMSs that support distributed transactions:
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL (with extensions like Postgres-XL)
- MySQL Cluster
- IBM DB2
