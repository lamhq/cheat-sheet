# Wide-column Database

## Overview

Stores data in a tabular format but organizes it differently from traditional relational databases:
- The set of columns can vary from row to row.
- Columns are grouped into "column families".

Optimized for queries over large datasets that access a subset of columns. Reading specific columns is very efficient.

Highly scalable for write-heavy workloads, Big Data scenarios.

Use cases: big data analytics, time-series data, real-time analytics, distributed workloads, high-volume logging.


## Data model

Data is stored in rows and columns.

Each data entry is identified by a unique combination of row key, column name, and timestamp:
- Each row can have a different set of columns, which can be very large in number (hence "wide-column").
- The timestamp can be used for versioning data.

Columns are grouped into "column families," which makes it easier to retrieve and manage related sets of data.


## Examples

- Apache HBase was the first open-source wide-column datastore.
- Cassandra
- ScyllaDB
