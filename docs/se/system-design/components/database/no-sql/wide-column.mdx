# Wide-column Database

## Overview

A wide-column database is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in a tabular format but organizes it differently from traditional relational databases.

Wide-column databases are row-oriented databases.

They're highly scalable and designed to handle large volumes of data.

Ideal for use cases like big data applications, time-series data, real-time analytics, and distributed workloads.


## Data model

Data is stored in rows and columns.

Each data entry is identified by a unique combination of row key, column name, and timestamp:
- Each row can have a different set of columns, which can be very large in number (hence "wide-column").
- The timestamp can be used for versioning data.

Columns are grouped into "column families," which makes it easier to retrieve and manage related sets of data.


## Examples

- Apache HBase was the first open-source wide-column datastore.
- Cassandra
- ScyllaDB
