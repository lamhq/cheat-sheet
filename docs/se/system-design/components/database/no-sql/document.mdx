# Document Database

Document stores are for storing and retrieving a document consisting of nested objects (such as XML, JSON, and YAML).

In a key-value store, the value is opaque. But the document stores exploit the tree structure of the value to offer richer operations.

MongoDB is a popular example of a document store.
