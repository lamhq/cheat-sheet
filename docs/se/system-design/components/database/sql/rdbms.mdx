# Relational Databases (RDBMS)

## Overview

Stores data in structured tables with pre-defined schema (columns with specific data types).

Use SQL for data definition and manipulation.

Enforces relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.

Optimized for [OLTP](../sql.mdx#OLTP) workloads.

Guarantees [ACID properties](../transaction.mdx#ACID-properties) for transactions.

RDBMSs are row-oriented databases.

Excellent choice for **highly structured data**, **strong consistency**, and **complex relational queries**.

> [!NOTE]
> Traditional RDBMS cannot handle the massive scale needed for Big Data analytics.

- Cloud Agnostic: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
