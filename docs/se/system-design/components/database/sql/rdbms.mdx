# Relational Databases

## Overview

Relational Databases (RDBMS) are optimized for OLTP workloads requiring fast reading and updating a large number of rows.

RDBMSs are row-oriented databases.

RDBMSs are optimized for transaction operations. 

Query and transactions are expressed using Standard Query Language (SQL).

Indexes are optimized for frequent low-latency writes of ACID Transactions.

Available RDBMSs options include:
- Cloud Agnostic: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, and MySQL
- AWS: Hosted PostgreSQL and MySQL in Relational Database Service (RDS)
- Microsoft Azure: Hosted SQL Server as Azure SQL Database
- Google Cloud: Hosted PostgreSQL and MySQL in Cloud SQL, and also horizontally scaling Cloud Spanner

> [!NOTE]
> Traditional RDBMS cannot handle the massive scale needed for Big Data analytics.


## Data structure

The data is organized in tables. Tables are normalized for reduced data redundancy and better data integrity.

Tables may have primary and foreign keys:
- Primary Key is a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely identifies a record (row) in a table.
- Foreign Key establishes relationships between tables. It is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.
