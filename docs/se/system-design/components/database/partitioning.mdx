# Partitioning

## Overview

Partitioning is just a general term, referring to the process of dividing tables in a database instance into smaller sub-tables or partitions.

These partitions can be accessed and managed separately to enhance performance, maintainability, and availability of the database.


## Types of Partitioning

- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Splits the table into rows. Each partition contains a subset of the rows.
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Splits the table into columns. Each partition contains a subset of the columns.


## Benefits

- **Enhances query performance** by reducing the amount of data needs to be scanned or accessed.
- **Helps build smaller indexes** that can fit into memory.
- **Simplifies maintenance tasks** like backups and indexing within a single database instance.


## Downsides

- **Complexity of maintainance**. Backup and recovery procedures become more difficult when dealing with multiple partitions.
- **Potential Wasted Space**. If partitions are not evenly distributed, some may be underutilized, leading to wasted storage.
- Querying data from all partitions is expensive
- Harder to maintain uniqueness across partitions


## Partitioning strategies

### List Partitioning

Data is divided based on a predefined list of values. Each partition contains rows that match one of the specified values.

Useful when you have a limited number of discrete values, such as categorizing data by country or department.

**Example**: Partitioning a customer table by country, where each partition contains customers from a specific country.

**Cons**:
- Uneven data distribution
- Need to move data between tables when a record change its value.


### Range Partitioning

Data is divided based on a range of values. Each partition holds rows where the partition key falls within a specific range.

Ideal for data that naturally falls into ranges, such as dates or numerical values.

**Example**: Partitioning a sales table by month, where each partition contains sales data for a specific month.

**Pros**:
- You can get rid of old data

**Cons**:
- Uneven data distribution


### Hash Partitioning

Data is divided based on a hash function applied to the partition key. The hash function distributes rows evenly across partitions (e.g., modulo function).

Effective for evenly distributing data when there is no natural range or list to partition by.

**Example**: Partitioning a user table by user ID, where the hash function ensures an even distribution of users across partitions.

**Pros**:
- Uneven data distribution

**Cons**:
- Works only if data is accessed by key
- Changing number of partitions is hard
