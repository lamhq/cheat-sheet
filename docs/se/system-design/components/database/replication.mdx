# Replication

## Overview

Replication is a process where data is duplicated and stored in multiple locations to ensure redundancy and reliability.

There's a primary database that only supports write operations. Secondary databases mirror the primary's dataset and only supports read operations.

## Advantages

- **Better performance**. This allows more queries to be processed in parallel across secondary nodes
- **Reliability**. Since data is replicated across multiple locations, when a disaster happens on one of the database servers, data is still preserved.
- **High availability**: your website remains in operation even if a database is offline as you can access data stored in another database server.


## Failover

When one of the database servers goes offline:
- If a secondary database goes offline.
  - If there's no other secondary database, read operations will be directed to the primary database temporarily.
  - Otherwise, read operations are redirected to other healthy secondary databases.
- If the primary database goes offline, a secondary database will be promoted to be the new primary.

> [!CAUTION]
> In production systems, promoting a new primary is more complicated as the data in a secondary database might not be up to date. The missing data needs to be updated by running data recovery scripts.\
> Although some other replication methods like multi-primarys and circular replication could help, those setups are more complicated;
