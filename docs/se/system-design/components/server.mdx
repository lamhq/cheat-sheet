# Server

## Server

A server is a machine that run an application that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Servers can host websites, manage databases, handle email, and perform many other tasks..


## Stateful Servers

A stateful server remembers client data (state) from one request to the next. The client's state is stored locally on the server.

Stateful architecture require every request from the same client must be routed to the same server.

> In below figure, user A's session data is stored in Server 1. To authenticate User A, HTTP requests must be routed to Server 1. If a request is sent to other servers like Server 2, authentication would fail because Server 2 does not contain User A's session data.

## Stateless Servers

Stateless architecture refers to a design where each request from a client to the server is treated as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request.

State data is stored in a shared data store and kept out of web servers.

Each request contains all the information the server needs to fulfill it. Requests from a client can be sent to any of the servers.

### Benefits

- Simplified Server Design. Servers are simpler to design and manage because they do not need to handle session state.
- Improved Scalability. Stateless servers can be easily scaled out to handle more requests, as there is no need to synchronize session state across servers.
- Fault Tolerance. If a server fails, another server can handle the request without any loss of session data.
- Ease of Maintenance. Stateless systems are easier to maintain and debug because each request is independent and self-contained.
- Better Performance. Reduced overhead from managing session state can lead to better performance and faster response times.


### Use cases

- **RESTful APIs**: REST is a popular architectural style for designing networked applications, and it relies on stateless communication.
- **Microservices**: Stateless architecture is often used in microservices to ensure that each service can operate independently and scale efficiently.
- **Serverless Computing**: Platforms like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are inherently stateless, allowing for automatic scaling and efficient resource utilization.
