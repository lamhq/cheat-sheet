# Materialized View

## Overview

The Materialized View pattern is an architectural approach to improve query performance by creating pre-populated, "materialized" views of data in a format optimized for the query needs.

Instead of querying multiple data stores directly, you maintain a read-optimized copy of the data that's updated periodically or in response to changes.

In Microservices architecture, it helps eliminates the need for expensive, synchronous cross-service calls for reads

## Benefits

1. Query Performance & Reduced Latency
2. Reduced Complex Joins or Cross-service calls in Microservices
3. Data Optimized for Queries
4. Reduced Load on Data Source


## Challenges

1. Data Duplication. You now have copies of data in multiple places.
2. Data Synchronization Frequency. How often to refresh the view?
   - Regenerate the view when source data changes can lead to overhead if the source data changes rapidly. 
   - Alternatively, consider using a scheduled task, an external trigger, or a manual action to regenerate the view.
3. Storage Costs: The potential for high storage costs if a large number of views are created.


## Where to use?

1. Read-heavy applications
2. The source data is not in an ideal format for querying.
3. The data is difficult or slow to query directly.
4. Querying the data requires complex joins or other computationally intensive operations.
