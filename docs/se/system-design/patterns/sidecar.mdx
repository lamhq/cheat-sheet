# Sidecar

## Overview

A design pattern is a design pattern where a helper container (Sidecar) runs alongside the main application container within the same Kubernetes Pod.

The main container runs core business logic, the sidecar container run a separate process that provides supporting or common functionality.

Because the sidecar runs in the same Pod, it share the same network, storage volume and life cycle.

The sidecar pattern abstract away common functionalities from application code into a separate reusable container.


## Benefits

1. **Decoupling & Separation of Concerns**. Moves cross-cutting logic out of app code, keep microservices focused on its business purpose
2. **Reusability**. The same sidecar container can be attached to many different microservices without any code changes in those services
3. **Language Independence**. It can be written in different languages than the main app
4. **Independent Updates**. You can update the functionality of the sidecar without having to rebuild or redeploy your main app container


## Challenges

1. **Complexity**. Manage more containers and increase resource usage of each pod (e.g., CPU, memory)
