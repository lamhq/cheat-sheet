# Tumbling Window

## Overview

Consumers divide time into fixed, non-overlapping time buckets. 

Each event in the stream fall into only one window

Once the window closes, consumer aggregates those events and produces the result as a single event.

The result can be a sum, an average summary, ... and can be emitted to another channel.

> The message broker is unaware of the concept of tumbling window. The consumer is fully responsible for buffering events.

## Use Cases

### Processing sensor data

A tumbling window can be used to compute average sensor readings—like temperature or energy usage—over fixed intervals (e.g., 10 seconds).

To improve accuracy, a trimmed mean technique can be used to discard outliers (e.g., top and bottom 10%), producing cleaner, more reliable data for downstream processing.


### Log analysis

We can use the tumbling window per hour to calculate error rates from production logs.

Then if we detect that in a certain window the error rate exceeds some threshold, we can send an alert to notify engineers.


### Daily Revenue Calculation

In e-commerce systems, a 24-hour tumbling window can track seller revenue.

At each window’s end, we produce the total revenue report for each seller, and send to them or calculate payouts.


## Advantages

1. **Simplicity**. Easy to implement and understand.
2. **Efficiency**. Minimal memory usage since old data is discarded.
3. **Clear Boundaries**. Each event belongs to one window only.
4. **Ideal for Periodic Reporting**. Ideal for dashboards, alerts, and summaries.


## Disadvantages

1. **Low Granularity of results**. Insights only arrive at the end of each window.
2. **Delayed Alerts**. Critical spikes (e.g., errors) may go unnoticed until the window closes.
3. **Poor Pattern Detection**. Trends that span across windows may be missed.
4. **Boundary Blindness**. Events split across windows can distort analysis (e.g., 11 errors split into 6 + 5 won't trigger a 10-error alert).
