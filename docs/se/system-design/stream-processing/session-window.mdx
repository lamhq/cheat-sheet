# Session Window

## Overview

Consumers start a window when a particular type of event happen (e.g., user login) and closes after a period of inactivity or a particular event (e.g., user logout).

## Characteristics

The size of the window is dynamic and is determined based on the time between the first event and the last event in the session.

Windows are always created per user, key, device ID, etc.

Each user will have no more than one active session window open at any given moment.


## Use Cases

### IOT

Session windows are ideal for IoT scenarios like autonomous vacuum cleaners, which emit sensor data (location, temperature, or amount of dust) during sessions.

They help detect patterns like decreased efficiency, increased energy consumption, allow us to suggest maintenance to the users.

### Driving & Navigation

Navigation apps use session windows to track driving activity. 

Each session starts when movement begins and ends with inactivity (location not change) or app closure.

Location and speed data are sent to the cloud to optimize routes and reduce congestion for other drivers.


## Benefits

1. **Great for real-time user analytics**. Ideal for tracking behavior in apps or services.
2. **Dynamic window size**: Events are grouped based on actual activity, not fixed time intervals.
3. **Efficient processing**: Each event belongs to only one session window, avoiding redundant computation (unlike hopping or sliding windows where events may be processed multiple times).


## Challenges

1. **Defining the Inactivity Threshold**
   - **Too short**: May close a session prematurely (e.g., user pauses briefly or switches tabs).
   - **Too long**: Keeps sessions open unnecessarily, increasing memory usage.
   - Human behavior is unpredictable, so it's hard to know when a session truly ends.
2. **Managing Many Windows**
   - Each session window is tied to a specific user or event key.
   - High user volume or long sessions (e.g., video streaming, navigation apps) can lead to many active windows, straining system resources.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Use multiple consumer instances, each handling a subset of users or event keys.
- Continuously monitor CPU and memory usage to scale up or down the number of instances based on demand to optimize performance and resource efficiency.
