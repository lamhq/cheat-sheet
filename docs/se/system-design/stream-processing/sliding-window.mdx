# Sliding Window

## Overview

Consumers divide time into fixed time buckets (similar to the tumbling window), but every new event will start a new window.

## Characteristics

Unlike the hopping window strategy, the advanced interval between windows is dynamic and is aligned to events instead of fixed points in time.

The strategy is great when events arrive at irregular intervals:
- if we have frequent events, we will have many overlapping windows
- if we have a low volume of events, we will have fewer windows


## Advantages

- **Real-time monitoring**: excellent for detecting patterns and anomalies as they happen.
- **Flexible advance interval**: Unlike hopping windows, sliding windows move forward based on event timing, not fixed intervals.
- **High responsiveness**: The window advances as frequently as new events arrive, ensuring no delay in analysis.


## Disadvantages

- **High resource cost**. The number of windows is directly correlated to the number of events. when the volume of events is high, the memory footprint and complexity can become quite significant.


## Use Cases

### Fraud detection

Assume that we have a rule that detects fraud by flagging any credit card used over 10 times in one minute. If triggered, it freezes the account and sends alerts to the cardholder.

Using a sliding window, each event starts a new 1-minute window; once it ends, results are computed and alerts triggered if the threshold is exceeded.

### API rate limiting and throttling

Each request triggers an event to the message broker, which is processed by a rate limiting service that uses a sliding window to track usage per user or client.

If a quota is exceeded, the system blocks further requests and returns a "too many requests" responseâ€”helping prevent DDoS attacks and ensuring fair access.
