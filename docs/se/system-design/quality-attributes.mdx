# Quality Attributes

## Overview

Quality attributes describe how well the system performs on a particular dimension.

Some important quality attributes:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Availability
- Fault Tolerance

Three important terms that aggregate system reliability regard to those quality attributes:
- SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- SLO (Service Level Objective)
- SLI (Service Level Indicator)


## Service-level agreement

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a service provider and its clients/users. It defines the expected level of service and outlines the consequences if those expectations aren't met.

It's a legal contract that represents the promise we make to our users in terms of quality service, such as:
- Availability
- Performance
- Data durability
- Time to respond to system failures

It states the penalties and financial consequences, if we breach the contract. Include:
- Full/Partial refunds
- Subscription/License extensions
- Service credits

SLAs exist for:
- External paying users
- Free external users (sometimes, don't publish SLA)
- Internal users within our company (occasionally, don't include penalties)

Example: _AWS EC2 instances have a 90% uptime guarantee, but no assurance beyond that. If an instance fails too often, AWS may refund charges but users still suffer downtime._


## Service-Level Objectives

While SLAs set external commitments, SLOs are internal targets that teams aim to meet, ensuring teams work toward high-quality service beyond contractual obligations.

Example: Customer Support Ticket Resolution Time: "Resolve 80% of critical support tickets within 4 hours."

Why SLOs matter?
- They help teams define their own standards for performance.
- Ensuring all teams meet their SLOs will likely satisfy SLAs but also improve overall reliability.
- SLOs may go beyond SLAs, setting aspirational goals or focusing on internal improvements.


## Service-Level Indicator

A Service-Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantitative measure of a system's behavior, used to determine whether SLOs are being met.

Examples:
- **Response time** (e.g., how fast a request is processed).
- **Customer registration success rate** (ensuring users can sign up).
- **Error rate** (how often failures occur).
- **Order completion rate** (tracking successful transactions).

Benefits:
- Without real measurements, teams can't assess whether they are hitting their SLO targets.
- SLIs help organizations optimize performance and ensure reliability.


## Error budgets

Error budgets define the acceptable amount of downtime or failures within a system

For example: If a system has an SLO of 99.9% availability per quarter, it allows up to 2 hours and 11 minutes of downtime. This downtime forms the error budget (the amount of failure a team is allowed before corrective actions are needed).

Using error budgets for decision-making:
- If a team is well below the budget, they can safely experiment (e.g., rolling out a new microservice).
- If they exceed the budget, they should prioritize stability, postponing risky deployments.
