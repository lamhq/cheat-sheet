# Quality Attributes

## Overview

[Quality attributes](./requirements.mdx#non-functional-requirements) describe how well the system performs on a particular dimension.

Some important quality attributes:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Availability
- Fault Tolerance

Three important terms that aggregate system reliability regard to those quality attributes:
- SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- SLO (Service Level Objective)
- SLI (Service Level Indicator)

SLAs are crafted by the business and the legal team. SLOs and SLIs are defined and set by the software engineers and architects.


## Service Level Agreement

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a service provider and its clients/users. It defines the expected level of service and outlines the consequences if those expectations aren't met.

It's a legal contract that represents the promise we make to our users in terms of quality service, such as:
- Availability
- Performance
- Data durability
- Time to respond to system failures

It states the penalties and financial consequences, if we breach the contract. Include:
- Full/Partial refunds
- Subscription/License extensions
- Service credits

Example: _"Our cloud service guarantees 99.9% uptime per month, with service credits issued if availability drops below this threshold"_

SLAs exist for:
- **External Paying Users**: SLAs are most commonly used here, with clear legal and financial terms.
- **Free External Users**: SLAs may still apply in limited cases, such as free trials, where compensation (e.g., trial extensions) may be offered if service fails.
- **Internal Users**: SLAs can exist between teams within the same organization, especially when one team depends on another to meet its own external commitments. These internal SLAs usually don’t include financial penalties.

SLAs help:
- Set clear expectations
- Build trust with users
- Ensure accountability
- Align internal teams on service goals

Even if a service is free, offering an SLA can demonstrate professionalism and commitment, though most companies avoid strict SLAs for free public services to reduce liability.


## Service-Level Objectives

SLOs are the individual goals that we set for our system.

Each SLO defines a performance target or acceptable range that our service needs to meet.

For example, we can have:
- Availability Service Level Objective of _3 nines_
- Response Time SLO of _less than 100 milliseconds at the 90th percentile_
- Issue Resolution Time Objective of _between 24 and 48 hours_

### Relationship to SLA

If a system has an SLA, each SLO represents a specific promise about a metric within that contract.

An SLA aggregates all the SLOs in a single legal document. While SLAs set external commitments, SLOs are internal targets to meet.

Even without an SLA, SLOs are essential for internal alignment and user trust.

### Why SLOs matter?

- They define clear performance expectations.
- They help teams measure success and detect regressions.
- Achieving SLOs will likely satisfy SLAs but also improve overall reliability.


### Best Practices

1. Define SLOs around metrics that most matter to users
2. Promising fewer SLOs is better. Too many SLOs make it hard to prioritize.
3. Setting realistic goals with a budget for errors
   - Commit to a lower threshold (e.g., 99.9%) to:
     - Reduce operational costs
     - Allow room for unexpected issues
   - This is especially important when SLOs are part of an **external SLA**:
     - Internal SLOs can be more aggressive (e.g., 99.99%)
     - External SLOs should be conservative (e.g., 99.9%) to avoid penalties
4. Create a recovery plan for when SLOs aren't meet. The plan should include:
   - Automated alerts to engineers/DevOps
   - Automatic Failover/restarts/rollbacks/auto-scaling policies
   - Predefined handbooks on what to do in certain situations


## Service-Level Indicator

A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantitative metric that measures how well a system is performing against a specific SLO.

SLIs are actual numbers, collected through monitoring tools or system logs.

Once collected, SLIs are compared against SLOs to determine if the system is meeting its targets.

**Examples**:
- **Availability SLI**: Percentage of user requests that receive a successful response. It can be compared to the availability SLO that we set before.
- **Latency SLI**: The percentile distribution of response time can be compared to the latency SLO of 100 milliseconds at the 90th percentile that we set before.
- **Customer registration success rate**: ensuring users can sign up.
- **Error rate**: how often failures occur.
- **Order completion rate**: tracking successful transactions.

**Benefits**:
- Without real measurements, we wouldn't find any SLIs to validate that we meet our SLOs.
- If we can't prove that we meet the SLOs, we can't say that we meet our SLA.


## Error budgets

Error budgets define the acceptable amount of downtime or failures within a system

For example: If a system has an SLO of 99.9% availability per quarter, it allows up to 2 hours and 11 minutes of downtime. This downtime forms the error budget (the amount of failure a team is allowed before corrective actions are needed).

Using error budgets for decision-making:
- If a team is well below the budget, they can safely experiment (e.g., rolling out a new microservice).
- If they exceed the budget, they should prioritize stability, postponing risky deployments.
