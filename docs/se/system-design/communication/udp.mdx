# UDP

## Overview

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a network protocol used for transferring data across the internet.

Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking. UDP is simpler, has lower overhead

UDP is suitable for applications where speed is crucial. It's commonly used for time-sensitive applications, where occasional data loss is acceptable, such as:
- video streaming
- monitoring metrics
- online gaming
- DNS lookups


## TCP vs. UDP

| ТСР | UDP |
|---|---|
| Slow | Fast |
| Expects confirmation from the Receiver | Just sends packets of information |
| Numbers each message | Good when there's a constant stream of data |
| Most common networking protocol |  |
