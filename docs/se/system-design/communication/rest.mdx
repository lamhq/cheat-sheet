# REST

## Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, it contains a set of principles that guide the design of web-based applications and services.

REST treats everything as a resource, identified by a URL.

These resources are accessed using standard HTTP methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

REST follows a stateless approach, each request from a client  contains all the necessary information for the server to process it, no need for the server to remember previous interactions.


## REST and HTTP

REST primarily uses the HTTP protocol.

HTTP aligns well with REST's architectural principles:
- Stateless Communication
- Standard Methods
- Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
- Caching Support

HTTP brings a large ecosystem of **supporting tools** and technology: caching proxies, load balancers, monitoring tools.

There are several mechanisms that enhance security for HTTP: HTTPS, OAuth, JWT, Basic Auth, Access control headers, Content Security Policy, HttpOnly Cookie.

HTTP can also be used to implement **RPC** (for example, SOAP runs over HTTP).


## HATEOAS

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a REST principle that allows clients to navigate and interact with an API dynamically through hyperlinks provided in responses.

Instead of hardcoding API endpoints, clients discover actions from server-provided links. This gives a huge amount of decoupling between the client and the server.

*For example, a client doesn't need to know which URI scheme to access to buy the **product**; it just need to access the resource, find the **buy control**, and navigate to that. The buy control could change location but the client wouldn't care.*

In practice, many APIs rely on predefined routes, making HATEOAS a hard concept to promote.

HATEOAS can introduce additional performance issues due to navigating multiple round trips to find the right endpoints.


## Challenges

1. Ease of consumption. generating client-side code for REST was not as straightforward as with RPC. Client libraries can cause coupling between client and server.
2. Performance. HTTP rely on TCP, which may be inefficient compared to other networking protocols (such as UDP).


## Where to use it

1. You need to support a **wide range of external clients**, REST-over-HTTP ensures interoperability across a wide range of technologies.
2. For **exposing APIs to external parties** or client interfaces.
3. Where you require large-scale and effective caching of requests
4. You want **looser coupling** between client and server (without requiring schema compilation, like RPC).
