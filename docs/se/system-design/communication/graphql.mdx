# GraphQL

## Benefits

GraphQL allows client-side devices to retrieve necessary data efficiently without multiple requests, improving query performance.

GraphQL reduces the number of calls and the amount of data to transfer, it can address challenges when building user interfaces with microservice architectures.


## How to use?

To use GraphQL, Microservices must expose a GraphQL endpoint, providing a schema that defines available types and often includes a graphical query builder to simplify query creation.


## Challenges

1. Complex queries can cause significant load on the server side.
2. GraphQL lacks of query planners, making it harder to diagnose problematic queries, compared to relational databases
3. Requests throttling can be complex to implement, especially when a call spans multiple microservices 
4. Caching in GraphQL is more complex to implement than RESTful APIs.

## Where to use it

1. GraphQL is well-suited for exposing functionality to external clients, particularly GUIs and mobile devices with data constraints and limited network capabilities.
2. It's useful for aggregating calls across multiple downstream microservices.

> [!NOTE]
> GraphQL doesn't replace general microservice-to-microservice communication; it complements it by providing a specific solution for client interactions.
