# RPC

## Overview

Remote procedure calls (RPC) is a technique that allows a program to execute a procedure on another computer over network as if it were a local procedure call.

There are different RPC implementations, such as SOAP and gRPC, which require an explicit schema.

RPC uses stubs to handle the communication between the client and server:
- **client stub** sends the request to the server
- **server stub** receives the request and executes the procedure

**Schema** makes it easier to generate **client and server stubs** for different technology stacks. For example, a Java server and a .NET client.

RPC technologies typically involve a serialization protocol that defines how data is serialized and deserialized.

One of the main advantages of RPC is the ease of generating client-side code (due to its explicit schema), making it simpler for clients to interact with remote services.

> [!NOTE]
> gRPC uses the Protocol Buffers serialization format.


## How RPC works

1. The client calls a local stub procedure.
2. The stub marshals (packs) the procedure parameters into a message.
3. The message is sent over the network to the server.
4. The server stub unmarshals (unpacks) the message and calls the actual procedure.
5. The procedure executes on the server.
6. The result is marshalled back into a message and sent to the client.
7. The client stub unmarshals the result and returns it to the client program.


## Challenges

1. **Technology Coupling**. Some RPC mechanisms are closely associated with a particular platform, which restricts the choice of technologies for both the client and server (for example, Java RMI ties both the client and server to the Java Virtual Machine).
2. **Local calls are not like remote calls**. The cost of marshaling and unmarshaling payloads can be significant. Simply exposing a local API as a service boundary without careful consideration is likely to cause problems. Also, networks can fail, and data can be malformed.
3. **Tighly coupled Client-Server**. Using an RPC mechanism with binary stub generation ties client and server deployments together. Any change, like adding or removing a field, requires regenerating client stubs—even if some clients don’t use the field. This can lead to lockstep releases.


## gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google for RPC APIs.

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for defining service interfaces and encoding/decoding messages.

gRPC use HTTP2 for transport, improve performance and lower latency.


### Advantages

1. Better performance compared to REST APIs (by using protobufs and HTTP2)
2. Supports authentication, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and token-based authentication.
3. Supports for load balancing and health checking, which is essential for building resilient distributed systems.


### Protobufs

Protobufs is a mechanism for serializing structured data into binary format.

Protobufs is language-neutral and platform-neutral.

Messages are much smaller than JSON or XML.

Protocol Buffers ensures that the API contracts are strongly typed, reducing the likelihood of errors due to mismatched data types.

How it works:
1. You define API interface in a `.proto` file
2. Use the `protoc` compiler to generate client and server code in your chosen language
3. The generated code can be used to serialize and deserialize data.


### Where to use it

gRPC is a good choice when:  
- **You have control over both client and server implementations**: Since gRPC requires client-side code to be compiled against the server’s schema, it works best in environments where you manage both sides.  
- **You need efficient, high-performance communication**: gRPC is optimized for low-latency and high-throughput scenarios, making it ideal for service-to-service communication in microservices architectures.  
- **Using synchronous request-response model**: While gRPC can work with reactive extensions, it’s primarily designed for structured request-response interactions.
