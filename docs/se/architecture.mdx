# Software Architecture

## Overview

The software architecture of a system is a high-level description of the system's structure, its different components, and how those components communicate with each other to fulfill the systems' requirements and constraints.

- It show us the important components while hiding the implementation details (technologies, programming languages)
- Requirements: what the system must do
- Constraints: what the system shouldn't do

Software architecture is the output of the Design phase and the input to the Implementation phase in the Software Development Cycle.

## Why does it matter?

Software architecture impacts:
- How our product will perform and scale
- How easy it will be to add new features
- How will it's going to respond to failures or security attack

Not doing a good job at the design phase can:
- Waste months of engineering time
- Build a system that doesn't meet our requirements

Restructuring a system that was not architected correctly is very hard and expensive


## Levels of abstraction

1. Classes/structs, communication between objects inside the program
2. Modules/packages/libraries
3. Services (processes / group of processes)


## Challenges

We cannot prove Software Architecture to be either:
- Correct
- Optimal

What we can do to guarantee success are:
- Follow a Methodical Design Process
- Apply Architectural Patterns & Best Practices
