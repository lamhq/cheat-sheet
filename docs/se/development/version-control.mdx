# Version control

## Overview

Version control, aka. source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.


## Version Control Systems

Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version control systems keep track of every modification to the code in their database. Developers can revert and compare earlier code versions to fix mistakes with minimal disruption to all team members.

**Git** is the most widely used version control system.


## Benefits of version control systems

1. **Change History:** Tracks all modifications, helping with bug fixes and maintaining older versions.  
2. **Branching & Merging:** Enables collaboration by allowing independent work streams that can be merged seamlessly.  
3. **Traceability:** Links changes to project management tools, aiding debugging and future planning.
