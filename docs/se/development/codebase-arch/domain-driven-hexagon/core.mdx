# Core

## Introduction

The center of the architecture, independent of frameworks, databases, or external systems.

Ensures the system’s business logic remains pure and technology-agnostic.

Divided into [Application Layer](./core/application.mdx) and [Domain Layer](./core/domain.mdx).


## Using libraries

Libraries in the core layer should be single responsibility libraries that help to implement domain logic (e.g., working with numbers).

Avoid libraries that:
- Access out-of-process resources (e.g., HTTP calls, database access).
- Add irrelevant functionality (e.g., frameworks, ORMs, loggers).
- Introduce randomness (e.g., random IDs, timestamps) that complicates testing.
- Have excessive dependencies.
