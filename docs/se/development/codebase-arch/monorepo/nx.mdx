# Nx

## Intro

Nx is a open source toolkit, build platform for managing monorepos.

You can adopt Nx incrementally. You can start with just the core and add additional capabilities as your needs grow.

Nx Core is a task runner. It understands project relationships and dependencies, allow fast task execution.


## Use cases

Nx is well-suited for JavaScript and TypeScript projects (Angular, React, Vue, Node.js, Java, etc.).


## Key Features

**Task Orchestration**
- Run tasks in parallel or sequence
- Only run tasks for projects affected by a given change
- Auto infer tasks based on tooling configuration (Vite, Jest, ESLint, etc)

**Caching**
- Speed up task execution with caching
- Enable local and distributed caching (via Nx Cloud)

**Code Generation**
- Allowing scaffolding new projects quickly
- Support multiple tech stacks and frameworks: Vite, Next.js, NestJS, Angular, React, Vue, Node.js, etc.

**Project Graph Visualization**
- Automatically generates a visual graph of all projects and their dependencies

**IDE Integration**
- Provide an UI that allows exploring the project, running tasks, code generation, installing plugins, etc.

**TypeScript support**
- Automatic configuring type inference for projects


## Limitations

- ⚠️ Complex configuration
- ⚠️ The documentation is lengthy and difficult to navigate.
- ⚠️ Nx centralizes all dependency definitions in the root `package.json` by default, making it unclear which dependencies belong to which project and complicating the transition to a monorepo structure.
