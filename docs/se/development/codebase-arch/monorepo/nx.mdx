# Nx

## Intro

Nx is a open source toolkit, build platform for managing monorepos.

You can adopt Nx incrementally. You can start with just the core and add additional capabilities as your needs grow.

Nx core is a task runner. It understands project relationships and dependencies, allow fast task execution.


## Use cases

Nx is well-suited for JavaScript and TypeScript projects (Angular, React, Vue, Node.js, Java, etc.).


## Installation

Install Nx CLI on macOS:

```sh
brew install nx
```

### Existing project

Add Nx to an existing repository:

```sh
nx init
```

### Non-Javascript repo

When running `nx init` in a directory without a `package.json` file, Nx will be installed in the `.nx/installation` directory

You can run Nx via a global Nx installation or the `nx` and `nx.bat` scripts that were created.


### From Presets

Create a new workspace with presets:
```sh
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```


## Editor Integration

Install [Nx Console extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for VSCode.


## Basic Commands

- `nx graph`: view an interactive graph
- `nx show projects`: list all projects
- `nx show project <project-name>`: view project detailed view
- `nx run-many -t <target>`: run task


## Explore the Project

Your workspace is a collection of projects.

Each project has different tasks which can be run.

Projects have dependencies between them and form a graph known as the **Project Graph**.

In addition to the project graph, Nx also tracks the dependencies between tasks as **Task Graph** to determine the way in which the tasks are executed.

Nx provides a UI which shows the information above.

### View all projects

To see all projects in your workspace:
- Open the project graph: `npx nx graph`
- Look at the Projects pane in Nx Console

### View project details

To view details of a project:
- View it in Nx Console
- Run `npx nx show project <project-name> --web`.
