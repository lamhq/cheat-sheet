# Turborepo

## Introduction

Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.

It is designed for scaling monorepos.


## Key Features

### Task Caching

A single monorepo might have thousands of tasks to execute. They need to be fast so developers can deliver high-quality code quickly.

[Remote Cache](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) stores the result of all your tasks, that speed up CI.

### Task Scheduling

Turborepo schedules your tasks, parallelizing work across all available cores.

### Easy Adoption

Turborepo can be adopted incrementally and you can add it to any repository in just a few minutes.

The configuration is lightweight, it add a single turbo.json file and leverages existing `package.json` scripts, dependencies you've already declared.
