# Managing Dependencies

Managing package's dependencies.

## Dependency Types

- **External dependencies** come from the npm registry, allowing you to leverage valuable code from the ecosystem to build your applications and libraries faster.
- **Internal dependencies** let you share functionality within your repository.


## Best practices

### Install dependencies where they're used

Install dependencies directly in the package that uses it.

**Benefits**:
- **Improved clarity**: Each package clearly shows its own dependencies in its `package.json`, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Enhanced flexibility**: Packages can use different versions of the same dependency without conflicts, suitable when there are many teams working in the same codebase.
- **Better caching efficiency**: Keeping dependencies scoped to individual packages reduces unnecessary updates and improves cache hit rates compared to centralizing them at the root.


### Few dependencies in the root

Dependencies that belong in the workspace root are tools for managing the repository, such as `turbo`, `pnpm`, `prettier`, etc.
