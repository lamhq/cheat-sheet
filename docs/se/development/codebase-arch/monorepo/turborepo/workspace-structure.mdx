# Workspace Structure

## Overal structure

Below is a sample structure of a monorepo created using PNPM Workspace and Turborepo:

```
.
├── apps
│   ├── docs
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── web
│       └── package.json
├── packages
│   ├── ui
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── utils
│       └── package.json
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── turbo.json
```


## Specifying packages

The package manager provide a configuration file to describe the locations of your packages.

If using PNPM, it will be `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
```yaml title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "packages/*"
```

Using this configuration, every folder with a `package.json` in the `apps` or `packages` directories will be considered a package.

## Root package.json

The root `package.json` specify:
- The package manager to use
- The global scripts used by the workspace

```json title="package.json"
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "lint": "turbo run lint"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "latest"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.0.0"
}
```


## Root turbo.json

Configure the behavior of turbo:
- Define tasks to run
- Specify which tasks depends on others
- Control caching to cache task results
- Create custom workflows for different environments


## Package's content

A package / project is a self-contained unit with its own `package.json`, tooling configuration, and source code. 

Packages can also expose entrypoints, allowing other packages to import and use them (internal dependencies).

### `package.json`

The `package.json` file in a package contains:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the package within the workspace. Other packages can import it using this name.
- `scripts`: Custom commands that run in the context of the package (e.g., `build`, `test`, `lint`).
- `exports`: Defines the entrypoints that other packages can access. The package can [export TypeScript directly](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages#just-in-time-packages), or a [compiled JavaScript file](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages#compiled-packages).

> [!INFO]
> It's best practice to use a namespace prefix for your Internal Packages to avoid conflicts with other packages on the npm registry. For example, if your organization is named `acme`, you might name your packages `@acme/package-name`.


### Source code

Packages commonly use an `src` folder to store their source code and compile to a `dist` folder.


### Configuration files

If you're using TypeScript, you likely don't need a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your workspace. Packages should independently specify their own configurations. You can have a shared `tsconfig.json` from a separate package in the workspace, and other packages can extend from it.
