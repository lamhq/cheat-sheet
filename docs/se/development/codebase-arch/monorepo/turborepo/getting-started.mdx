# Getting Started

## Installation

Install turbo globally to quickly scaffold new project anywhere:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install turbo --global" />


## Creating project

Create a full-stack NestJS + Next.js monorepo:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-nestjs
```

Useful templates:
- [Vite React Example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-vite-react)
- [Next.js Examples](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-nextjs)
- [All Turborepo Examples](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples)


## For existing project

1. Install `turbo` package to your project.
2. Define tasks in `turbo.json`.
3. Add `.turbo` to your `.gitignore`.
4. Add a `packageManager` field to root `package.json`.
5. Set up your workspace's structure and configure package manager workspaces (PNPM, NPM, Yarn).
6. Run defined tasks with `turbo` command.
7. Enabling Remote Caching in [CI](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/constructing-ci)

View the detailed instructions [here](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/add-to-existing-repository).


## Adding applications

### NestJS

1. Create a new NestJS application using the Nest CLI:
    ```bash
    npx @nestjs/cli new nestjs-app --package-manager pnpm --language ts --strict
    ```
2. Move the generated NestJS app into the `apps` directory of your TurboRepo monorepo.
3. Install the `typescript-config` package to the NestJS app:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @your-monorepo/typescript-config -D --filter=nestjs-app
   ```
4. Update the `tsconfig.json` of the NestJS app to extend the shared TypeScript configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/nestjs.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "outDir": "./dist",
      }
    }
    ```
5. Update `package.json` script names of the NestJS app to match with the root `package.json` scripts to when running commands from the project root will cascade to all apps and packages.


## Exploring the workspace

Show the packages in your repository and where they're located:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo ls
```

Show all packages that depend on a specific package:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo ls --filter=...ui
```

Show all tasks:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo run
```


## Managing packages

You can manually add or remove packages based on your package manager's [workspace structure](./workspace-structure.mdx).

Ensure that each package folder includes its own `package.json` file to be recognized as part of the workspace.


## Installing Dependencies

Turborepo does not manage dependencies. It's up to your package manager (PNPM, Yarn, or NPM).


## Using the terminal UI

When running tasks with `turbo`, it use a dynamic view to shows which tasks are running, queued, or completed—organized by package and task name.

You can quickly adjust the UI to your needs using keybinds:

| Keybind | Action                                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m`     | Toggle popup listing keybinds                                     |
| `↑`/`↓` | Select the next/previous task in the task list                    |
| `j`/`k` | Select the next/previous task in the task list                    |
| `p`     | Toggle selection pinning for selected task                        |
| `h`     | Toggle visibility of the task list                                |
| `c`     | When logs are highlighted, copy selection to the system clipboard |
| `u`/`d` | Scroll logs `u`p and `d`own                                       |

Some of your tasks may allow you to type input into them. You can interact with tasks using the `i` keybind, press `Ctrl+z` to stop interacting.
