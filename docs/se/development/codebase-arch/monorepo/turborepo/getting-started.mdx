# Getting Started

## Install Turborepo

Install turbo globally to quickly scaffold new project anywhere:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install turbo --global" />


## Creating new workspace

Create from a [template](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/examples):

<PackageManagerTabs command="dlx create-turbo@latest" />


## For existing project

1. Install `turbo` package to your project.
2. Define tasks in `turbo.json`.
3. Add `.turbo` to your `.gitignore`.
4. Add a `packageManager` field to root `package.json`.
5. Set up your workspace's structure and configure package manager workspaces (PNPM, NPM, Yarn).
6. Run defined tasks with `turbo` command.
7. Enabling Remote Caching in [CI](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/constructing-ci)

View the detailed instructions [here](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/add-to-existing-repository).


## Exploring the workspace

Show the packages in your repository and where they're located:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo ls
```

Show all packages that depend on a specific package:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo ls --filter=...ui
```

Show all tasks:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo run
```


## Managing packages

You can manually add or remove packages based on your package manager's [workspace structure](./workspace-structure.mdx).

Ensure that each package folder includes its own `package.json` file to be recognized as part of the workspace.


## Installing Dependencies

Turborepo does not manage dependencies. It's up to your package manager (PNPM, Yarn, or NPM).


## Using the terminal UI

When running tasks with `turbo`, it use a dynamic view to shows which tasks are running, queued, or completed—organized by package and task name.

You can quickly adjust the UI to your needs using keybinds:

| Keybind | Action                                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `m`     | Toggle popup listing keybinds                                     |
| `↑`/`↓` | Select the next/previous task in the task list                    |
| `j`/`k` | Select the next/previous task in the task list                    |
| `p`     | Toggle selection pinning for selected task                        |
| `h`     | Toggle visibility of the task list                                |
| `c`     | When logs are highlighted, copy selection to the system clipboard |
| `u`/`d` | Scroll logs `u`p and `d`own                                       |

Some of your tasks may allow you to type input into them. You can interact with tasks using the `i` keybind, press `Ctrl+z` to stop interacting.
