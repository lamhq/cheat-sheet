3. Add `.turbo` to your `.gitignore`.
4. Add a `packageManager` field to root `package.json`.

View the detailed instructions [here](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/add-to-existing-repository).


## Managing packages

You can manually add or remove packages based on your package manager's [workspace structure](./workspace-structure.mdx).

Ensure that each package folder includes its own `package.json` file to be recognized as part of the workspace.


## Installing Dependencies

Turborepo does not manage dependencies. It's up to your package manager (PNPM, Yarn, or NPM).
