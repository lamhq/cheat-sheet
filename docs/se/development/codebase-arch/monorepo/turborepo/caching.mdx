# Caching

## How it works

When your task is cacheable, Turborepo will restore the results of your task from cache using a fingerprint from the first time the task ran.

Turborepo stores the results of tasks in the `.turbo/cache` directory on your machine. You can enable [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share this cache with your teammates and CI.


## What gets cached?

Turborepo caches two types of outputs: Task outputs and Logs.

Task outputs:
- file outputs of a task that are defined in the `outputs` key of the task in `turbo.json`
- you can omit task outputs, but Turborepo will not cache files after running that task

Logs:
- Turborepo always captures the terminal outputs of your tasks, restoring those logs to your terminal from the first time that the task ran.


## Task inputs

Inputs are hashed by Turborepo, creating a "fingerprint" for the task run. When "fingerprints" match, running the task will hit the cache.


## Troubleshooting

- You can use the `--dry` flag when running your tasks to see what would happen if you ran a task without actually running it.
- The `--summarize` flag can be used to get an overview of all of a task's inputs, outputs, and more. This can be useful for debugging inputs and outputs.
