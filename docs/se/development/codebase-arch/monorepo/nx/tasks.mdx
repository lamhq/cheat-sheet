# Tasks

## Overview

Nx provides a powerful task runner that allows you to:
- **run multiple targets** for multiple projects in **parallel**
- define task pipelines to run tasks **in correct order**
- only run tasks for changed projects
- speed up task execution with **caching**

You can view and run tasks using Nx Console extension.


## Define Tasks

Tasks can be from:
- existing `package.json` scripts
- inferred from plugins
- defined in a `project.json` file

**Root-Level Tasks** are tasks that apply to the entire codebase rather than a single project. You can define them in the root-level `package.json` or `project.json` as follows:

```json title="project.json"
{
  "name": "myorg",
  ...
  "targets": {
    "docs": {
      "command": "node ./generateDocsSite.js"
    }
  }
}
```


## Run Tasks

Syntax: `nx <task name> <project name> <options>`

Run `build` task for `my-app` project in watch mode:
```sh
npx nx build my-app --watch
```

Run the build task for all projects in the repo:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build
```

Run the `build`, `lint` and `test` task for all projects in the repo:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build lint test
```

Run the build, lint, and test tasks only on the project-a and project-b projects:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build lint test -p project-a project-b
```

Run tasks on projects [affected](https://nx.dev/ci/features/affected) by a PR:
```sh
npx nx affected -t test
```


## Defining a Task Pipeline

Require one task to be run before another.

Nx can automatically detect the dependencies between projects.
