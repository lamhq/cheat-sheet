# Tasks

## Overview

Nx provides a powerful task runner that allows you to:
- **run multiple targets** for multiple projects in **parallel**
- define task pipelines to run tasks **in correct order**
- only run tasks for changed projects
- speed up task execution with **caching**

You can view and run tasks using Nx Console extension.


## Define Tasks

Tasks can be from:
- existing `package.json` scripts
- inferred from plugins
- defined in a `project.json` file

### Root-Level Tasks

Root-Level Tasks can be defined in the root-level `package.json` or `project.json` as follows:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "myorg",
  "scripts": {
    "docs": "echo 'hello'"
  },
  "nx": {}
}
```

```json title="project.json"
{
  "name": "myorg",
  ...
  "targets": {
    "docs": {
      "command": "node ./generateDocsSite.js"
    }
  }
}
```

To run a the task:
```sh
nx run myorg:docs
nx docs myorg
```


### Continuous Tasks

Labeling a task as continuous tells Nx to not wait for the process to exit, and it will be run alongside its dependents.

```json title="apps/myapp/project.json"
{
  "targets": {
    "serve": {
      "continuous": true
    }
  }
}
```


## Customize inferred tasks

Nx plugins can detect your tooling configuration files (e.g. `vite.config.ts` or `.eslintrc.json`) and automatically configure runnable tasks.

For example:
- `@nx/jest` plugin will automatically create a `test` task for projects that use Jest.
- `@nx/vite` create `build`, `serve`, `preview` tasks for projects that use Vite.

The task names can be configured in the `nx.json` file:

```json title="nx.json"
{
  ...
  "plugins": [
    {
      "plugin": "@nx/vite/plugin",
      "options": {
        "buildTargetName": "build",
        "testTargetName": "test",
        "serveTargetName": "serve",
        "previewTargetName": "preview",
        "serveStaticTargetName": "serve-static"
      }
    },
    {
      "plugin": "@nx/eslint/plugin",
      "options": {
        "targetName": "lint"
      }
    },
    {
      "plugin": "@nx/jest/plugin",
      "options": {
        "targetName": "test"
      }
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```


## Run Tasks

Syntax: `nx <task name> <project name> <options>`

Run `build` task for `my-app` project in watch mode:
```sh
npx nx build my-app --watch
```

Run the build task for all projects in the repo:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build
```

Run the `build`, `lint` and `test` task for all projects in the repo:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build lint test
```

Run the build, lint, and test tasks only on the project-a and project-b projects:
```sh
npx nx run-many -t build lint test -p project-a project-b
```

Run tasks on projects [affected](https://nx.dev/ci/features/affected) by a PR:
```sh
npx nx affected -t test
```

## Task Pipeline

Require one task to be run before another.

Nx can automatically detect the dependencies between projects. 

### Defining Task Pipeline

Run the `build` target of all dependencies first:

```json title="nx.json"
{
  ...
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Ensures that `tests` only run after the `build` is complete:
```json title="nx.json"
{
  ...
  "targetDefaults": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Visualize Task Dependencies

You can visualize the actual task graph by running:
```sh
nx graph
```

Alternatively you can use the Nx Console extension in VSCode. Right-click on the project and select `Focus task in Nx Graph`.
