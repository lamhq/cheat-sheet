# Generate Code

Generators are added through installing Nx plugins.

## Using Nx Console

Nx Console provides a visual interface to find and run generators:

## Using command line

Syntax: `nx g <plugin-name>:<generator-name> [options]`.

Generate a React library in `packages/mylib`:
```sh
nx g @nx/react:lib packages/mylib
```

Specify just the generator name and Nx will prompt you to pick between the installed plugins that provide a generator with that name:
```sh
nx g lib packages/mylib
```

To see a list of available generators in `@nx/react` plugin:
```sh
nx list @nx/react
```
