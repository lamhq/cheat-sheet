# Getting Started

## Installation

Install Nx CLI on macOS:

```sh
brew install nx
```

## Editor Integration

Install [Nx Console extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for VSCode.


## Start a new project

### Empty project

Create a `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-workspace",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
```

Add Nx to your workspace:

```sh
nx init
```

You can incrementally add functionality, like:
- configure caching
- adding Nx plugins
- optimizing your CI

> When running `nx init` in a directory without a `package.json` file, Nx will be installed in the `.nx/installation` directory. Then you can run Nx via a global Nx installation or the `nx` and `nx.bat` scripts that were created.


### From presets

```sh
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```

This interactive command will create a new workspace directory and let you choose a preset that matches your technology stack.


## Add Nx to an existing project

```sh
nx@latest init
```


## Explore the Project

Your workspace is a collection of projects.

Each project has different tasks which can be run.

Projects have dependencies between them and form a graph known as the **Project Graph**.

In addition to the project graph, Nx also tracks the dependencies between tasks as **Task Graph** to determine the way in which the tasks are executed.

Nx provides a UI which shows the information above.

### View all projects

To see all projects in your workspace:
- Open the project graph: `nx graph`
- Look at the Projects pane in Nx Console
- Run `nx show projects`

### View project details

To view details of a project:
- View it in Nx Console
- Run `nx show project <project-name> --web`.
