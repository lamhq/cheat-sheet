# Git

## Overview

Git is a version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development.

It was originally created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.

### Key Features
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Git is optimized for performance, using SHA compression to store changes efficiently.
- **Branching & Merging**: Git makes it easy to create branches for new features or experiments. 
- **Commit History**: Developers can make frequent commits (save points), which helps track progress and roll back changes if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Git supports syncing with remote repositories, enabling teams to work together seamlessly across locations.
