# Semantic Versioning

## Overview

Semantic versioning is a standardized way to versioning software to communicate changes and compatibility clearly to users and developers.

It uses the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to convey information about changes (e.g.,` 0.1.0` to `1.2.0`).


## Explanation

- When the `MAJOR` number increments, it indicates backward-incompatible changes have been made.
- An increment in the `MINOR` number signifies the addition of new functionality that should be backward compatible.
- A change in the `PATCH` number implies bug fixes have been made to existing functionality.

Versions in the `0.x.x` range indicate that the software is in its early development stages, is not considered stable or production-ready.

The release of version `1.0.0` signals that the software is considered reliable for production use.
