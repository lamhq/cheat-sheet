# Codebase Architecture

## Overview

Codebase Architecture refers to the organization of a software project's source code.

A well-designed architecture makes it easier to onboard new developers, scale features, and avoid technical debt.

## Common Architectural Styles

### Multirepo

Each project or service has its own repository.

Pros:
- **Autonomous Teams**. Teams can work independently on their own repos without interfering with others
- **Isolation of Projects**. Easier to manage dependencies and avoid unintended side effects.
- **Simplified Access Control**. You can restrict access to sensitive repositories without exposing the entire codebase.

Cons:
- **Cross-Service Changes**. Changes across repos can't be atomic, requiring multiple commits per repository
- **Introduce overhead when maintaining multiple repositories**. Requires maintaining awareness of all repositories and their respective functions.
- **Onboarding complexity**: Assigning new team members to the correct repositories may take additional time and effort.
- **Lack of standardization**: Teams may adopt different tools and coding conventions, making it difficult to enforce consistency.

### Monorepo

All code for multiple projects lives in a single repository.

Pros:
- Organize related applications and packages in a single repository
- Easily share code and dependencies

Cons:
-

### Modular

Code is split into reusable modules or packages, often with clear boundaries. Encourages separation of concerns and easier testing.

### Layered

Organizes code into layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access. Helps maintain structure and clarity in large applications.
