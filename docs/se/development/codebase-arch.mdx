# Codebase Architecture

## Overview

Codebase Architecture refers to the organization of a software project's source code.

A well-designed architecture makes it easier to onboard new developers, scale features, and avoid technical debt.


## Common Architectural Styles

### Multirepo

Each project / service / component has its own repository.

Suitable for projects where each component or service is independent or loosely coupled.

Use cases:
- **Distinct Teams and Ownership**: When different teams own and manage distinct projects, a multirepo provides clear ownership and autonomy.
- **Diverse technology stacks**: It allows teams to use the best tools and languages for their specific projects without being restricted to a single, company-wide stack.
- **Independent release cycles**: Teams can release their projects on their own schedule without having to coordinate with other teams.
- **Granular Security and Access Control**: Access to each project must be controlled individually, ensuring that developers only have access to the repository they need.

Benefits:
- **Autonomous Teams**. Teams can work independently on their own repos without interfering with others
- **Isolation of Projects**. Easier to manage dependencies and avoid unintended side effects.
- **Security**. You can restrict access to sensitive repositories without exposing the entire codebase.

Challenges:
- **Cross-Service Changes**. Changes across repos can't be atomic, requiring multiple commits per repository
- **Introduce overhead when maintaining multiple repositories**. Requires maintaining awareness of all repositories and their respective functions.
- **Onboarding complexity**: Assigning new team members to the correct repositories may take additional time and effort.
- **Lack of standardization**: Teams may adopt different tools and coding conventions, making it difficult to enforce consistency.


### Monorepo

All code for multiple projects lives in a single repository.

Monorepos are used by tech giants like Google, Meta(Facebook), Microsoft, Uber.

Use cases:
- **Tightly Coupled Projects**: A monorepo allows for atomic commits, keeping related projects like a frontend and backend in sync with a single update.
- **Significant Code Sharing**: It simplifies code sharing, as all projects can easily access common libraries and components from a single location.
- **Sharing Tooling and Conventions**: when consistent coding standards, build tools, and CI/CD pipelines across all projects are required.

Benefits:
- **Atomic Commits & Refactoring**. Developers can make sweeping changes across multiple projects in a single commit, which simplifies large-scale refactoring.
- **Unified Visibility & Collaboration**. Allow organizing related applications and packages in a single repository
- **Simplified Dependency Management**. Easily share code and dependencies
- **Consistent Tooling & Standards**. Easier to enforce coding conventions, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools across all teams.
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: New developers only need to clone one repo to access the entire codebase, speeding up setup and understanding.

Challenges:
- **Performance Issues**: As a monorepo grows, operations like cloning, fetching, and running builds can become slow. Tools and infrastructure need to be optimized to handle the large scale.
- **Tooling Complexity**: The tools used for version control, building, and testing must be able to handle a large and complex codebase efficiently. This often requires custom or highly specialized tooling.
- **Access Control**: Managing access and permissions can be more complicated. Since all code is in one repository, it can be difficult to restrict access to specific projects without complex configurations.
- **Learning Curve**: New developers may face a steeper learning curve when navigating a vast codebase. Onboarding can require more time to understand the project structure and various interdependencies.


### Layered

Organizes code into layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access. Helps maintain structure and clarity in large applications.


### Modular

Code is split into reusable modules or packages, often with clear boundaries. Encourages separation of concerns and easier testing.
