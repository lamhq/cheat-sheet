# Page-Based Decomposition

Page-based decomposition is a method of structuring a web-based user interface by dividing it into multiple independent web pages, each served by different microservices.

## How It Works?

- The UI is broken into distinct pages, each managed by its own microservice.
- Requests for specific pages go directly to the corresponding microservice.
- Each microservice fetches necessary data (e.g., stock availability from an Inventory microservice) to display relevant information.

## Advantages

- Simpler implementation: No need for complex JavaScript frameworks or iFrames
- Clear ownership: Each team fully controls the UI for the microservices they manage.
- Adaptability: The page content can adjust based on the requesting device, using techniques like progressive enhancement.

## Where to Use It?

- Ideal for breaking down large, web-based user interfaces efficiently.
- Helps avoid complexity seen in single-page applications, which often force websites into unnecessary app-like structures.

## Challenges

- Become less popular due to the shift toward SPAs, even when page-based decomposition might be a better fit.
