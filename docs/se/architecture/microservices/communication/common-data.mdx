# Communication Through Common Data

## Overview

One microservice puts data into a defined location, and another microservice then makes use of the data.

The data can be a file system, data lake or data warehouse.

Downstream microservice needs a mechanism to identify when new data is available (polling is a frequent solution).


## Advantages

- simple and can be implemented using common technologies
- can work well with different data volumes

## Disadvantages

- not useful in low-latency situations
- use polling or timed jobs to check for new data
- the data store becomes a potential source of coupling
- the robustness of data store affects the robustness communication

> [!NOTE]
> If you're interested in sending larger volumes of data and having them processed more in "real time," then using some sort of streaming technology like Kafka would be a better fit.


## Where to Use It?

- When there're restrictions on what technology can be used (legacy systems)
- sharing large volumes of data (multigigabyte file or million database rows)
