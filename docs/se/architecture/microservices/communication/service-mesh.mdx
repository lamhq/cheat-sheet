# Service Mesh

## Overview

A service mesh is a software layer that manages communication between microservices.

They provide common features for inter-microservice communication, such as mutual TLS, correlation IDs, service discovery, and load balancing.

Service meshes provide common functionalities that can be shared across microservices (this can be achieved by shared libraries, but microservices may have different versions or runtimes, lead to more challenges).

They enable flexible changes without requiring individual microservices to update and redeploy when using shared libraries.

Service meshes allow for the reuse of common inter-microservice functionality across microservices written in different programming languages.

Service meshes help implement standard behavior across microservices, fostering consistency and best practices.


## How it works

1. Each microservice has a lightweight proxy (**sidecar**) that handle all traffic between services. Instead of services talking directly to each other, they send requests through these proxies, which manage routing, security, and monitoring.
2. The **Control Plane** sets policies and configurations for service communication, while the **Data Plane** applies those rules by handling actual traffic between microservices,  including routing, retries, and encryption.

## In Kubernetes

When deploying microservices on Kubernetes, each microservice instance is placed in a pod, and each pod has its own local proxy.

If a proxy within a pod fails, it only affects that specific pod.

Many service mesh implementations rely on the **Envoy** proxy as the foundation for these locally running processes.

Proxies are managed and monitored by a control plane.


## Should i use it?

Service meshes aren't for everyone:
- They are primarily designed for Kubernetes
- They introduce extra complexity, if you only have a few microservices (< 5), it may not be necessary or cost-effective.
- Service mesh is not able to work as an intermediary for all calls between microservices (such as message broker).

Organizations with many microservices, especially across different programming languages, should consider service meshes.

Service meshes and API gateways are effective for protocols like REST, SOAP, gRPC, and similar HTTP-based communication methods.
