# Request-Driven Communication

## Overview

A microservice requests an action from a downstream service and expects a response with the result.

## Implementation: Synchronous (blocking)

A synchronous call opens a network connection to the downstream microservice to send the request.

This connection remains open while the upstream microservice waits for the response.

The responding microservice is unaware of the requester.


## Implementation: Asynchronous (nonblocking)

A request is sent as a message over a message broker, not directly to the downstream service.

The downstream microservice retrieves and processes messages from the queue at its own pace. It must know where to send the response back (e.g. the original queue it read from).

Using a queue allows buffering multiple requests, which prevents overwhelming the downstream service during peak loads. 

Upon receiving a response, the initiating microservice might need to correlate it with the original request, such as storing request state into a database.

All forms of request-driven communication require time-out handling to prevent blocking.

## Where to Use It?

Suitable when a respose is needed before further processing.

When a microservice wants to know if a call didn't work so that it can carry out some sort of compensating action, like a retry.
