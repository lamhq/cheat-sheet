# Communication Styles

## Synchronous blocking

A microservice makes a call to another microservice and blocks operation, waiting for the response.

**Advantages**: simple and familiar to many programmers

**Disadvantages**: 
- Temporal couling between caller and downstream microservice:
  - Failures occur if the downstream is unavailable
  - Responses are lost if the upstream dies
  - Can cause delays for the caller if the downstream is under significant load
- System is vulnerable to cascading failures from downstream outages

**Where to use**: for simple microservice architectures.

**Where not to use**: when you have many chains of calls:
- Any issue of involved microservices can cause the whole operation to fail.
- Long chains can cause significant resource contention (happens when multiple services compete for limited resources like CPU, memory, or database connections. In this case is network connection).


## Asynchronous nonblocking

The caller can carry other processing without having to wait for a response.

The three most common asynchronous communication styles in microservice:
1. **Communication through common data**. A microservice changes some common data, then other microservices later make use of.
2. **Request-driven**. A microservice requests another to perform an operation. Once completed, the upstream microservice receive the response, regardless of success or failure.
3. **Event-driven interaction**. A microservice broadcasts an event. Other microservices listen for the events they are interested in and react accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> With `Async/Await`, the caller code is still blocked until the awaited promise is resolved. So even if the underlying technology we are using could be considered asynchronous, this is still inherently a synchronous, blocking interaction.

**Advantages**: 
- Microservices are decoupled temporarily. the downstream microservice do not need to be reachable at the same time the call is made
- Beneficial for functionalities that take a long time to process

**Disadvantages**: More complex implementation and debugging

**Where to Use It**:
- long-running processes
- when you have long call chains that's not easily restructured
