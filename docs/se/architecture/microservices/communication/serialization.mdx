# Serialization

## Serialization Formats

Format is how we covert data for network calls.

### Textual Formats

**REST APIs** often use a textual format for the request and response bodies.

**JSON** has replaced **XML** as the preferred text serialization format due to its browser compatibility, compactness, and simplicity.

**Avro** is a schema-based serialization format built on JSON. It includes the schema in the payload, which can support different messaging formats much easier.


### Binary Formats

Binary serialization protocols is suitable when you're concerned about **payload size** or the **efficiency of writing and reading payloads**.

Protocol buffers (used by gRPC) is the most popular binary serialization format for microservice-based communication.


## Schemas

Schemas are used to define what our endpoints expose and what they accept.

Schemas help reduce the amount of documentation required.

Picking a serialization format will typically define which schema technology you can use.

*For example, XML use XML Schema Definition (XSD), JSON use JSON Schema.*

Explicit schema helps catching accidental breakages of microservice endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> Breakages refer to errors or issues that arise when changes made to a microservice endpoint in a way that make it incompatible with consumers.
