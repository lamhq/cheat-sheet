# Event-driven Communication

A microservice emit events, other microservices consume and react to accordingly.

The microservice publishing an event doesn't know which services will consume it, coupling is greatly reduced.

> [!NOTE]
> With request-driven, the sender knows what should be done and instructs the other service, indicating a stronger domain coupling due to the requester's awareness of the downstream service's capabilities.

## Implementation

Message brokers (e.g. RabbitMQ) enable microservices to emit and consume events.

Message brokers are typically scalable and resilient, they can also increase development complexity as another system to run for development and testing.

May require additional servers and expertise to keep the infrastructure up and running.


## Event structure

What should be inside an event so consumers can have what they need?

1. **Just an ID**: the event to just contain an identifier for the related entity (`ID`), consumers fetch the full information using this ID from another microservice. Downsides:
   1. Add domain coupling between consumers and the microservice contain data
   2. Might result to a lot of fetch requests from consumer
2. **Fully detailed events** (preferred). Put everything consumers need into an event. Allow for looser coupling, auditting, debugging. But the event size is limitted by the message broker

> Kafka, a message brokers, has the default maximum size for a message is 1 MB

## Where to Use It

Where information needs to be broadcast and downstream microservices can work independently.

Where loose coupling is preferred.

FYI, more teams replacing request-driven interactions with event-driven interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> Microservice architecture can contain a mix of different styles of interaction, so it's not necessary to go all in with event-driven collaboration.

## Disadvantages

Increase complexity:
- manage messages publishing and subscribing
- hadnling long-running async request-driven
- monitoring, request tracing with correlation IDs, debugging, replicating errors
- require rewire your brain to be accustomed to this communication style
