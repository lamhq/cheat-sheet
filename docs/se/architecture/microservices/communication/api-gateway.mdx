# API Gateway

## Overview

API gateways map external requests to internal microservices, often acting as a reverse proxy.

They can implement various features, including security mechanisms (e.g., API keys), request logging, rate limiting, ...

Commonly used for managing access to microservices via the public internet, they may be unnecessary if no third-party involvement is required.


## Where to Use?

For exposing microservices in Kubernetes, reverse proxies or specialized products like Ambassador can be useful.

If many third-party users need access, dedicated API management solutions may be more suitable.


## What to Avoid

Avoid using API gateways for **call aggregation** and **protocol rewriting**, as this can introduce unintended business logic. 

- **Call aggregation** is better handled by GraphQL or Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) patterns.
- **Protocol rewriting** (e.g., converting SOAP to REST) misplaces behavior that should be managed within microservices.

Placing too much behavior in API gateways leads to restricted control and more complicated change management.

Using API gateways for inter-microservice calls can introduce additional network hops and increase latency. Service meshes are much better placed to solve this problem.
