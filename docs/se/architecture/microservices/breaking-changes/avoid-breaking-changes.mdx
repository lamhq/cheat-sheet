# Avoiding Breaking Changes

Tips to avoid making breaking changes:

## Expansion Changes

Add new things to a microservice interface; don't remove old things.


## Tolerant Reader

Avoid client code to bind too tightly to the interface of a microservice:
- it should not bind to the extract data structure
- it should not break if the data structure evolves (adding new fields, format changing slightly, ...)
- it should gracefully handle unexpected or missing fields without rejecting the entire input

*An `Email` microservice that send emails to customers. To send the email, the microservice needs to get `firstname`, `lastname`, and `email` from the `Customer` data. The `Email` service only care about those fields and ignore the rest.*

> [!WARNING]
> Some binding technologies (especially that used by strongly typed languages) attempts to bind all fields even unused ones, which can cause consumers to break when a field is removed.


## Right Technology

Pick technology that makes it easier to make backward-compatible changes to the interface.

**Protocol buffers** (used with gRPC) assign each entry a field number, Client code relies on these numbers and can ignore newly added fields, ensuring compatibility.

**Avro** allows for the schema to be sent along with the payload, allowing clients to potentially interpret a payload much like a dynamic type.


## Explicit Interface

Be explicit about what a microservice exposes.

**Benefits**: 
- this clarifies what consumers can expect
- helps developers understand what they should not change to avoid breaking consumers
- it makes the boundaries of information more explicit.

**Schema in RPC vs. REST**: 

Explicit schemas is required in **RPC**.

For **REST**, it's optional. But the use of explicit schemas, like OpenAPI and JSON Schema, is becoming more common.


**Challenges in Asynchronous Messaging**: 

Asynchronous messaging protocols face challenges in having explicit schemas for events.

It's more complex to define the interface for events than defining schemas for message payloads.

AsyncAPI and CloudEvents may address this issue.


## Catch Breaking Changes Early

Tools to catch breaking changes before deploying to productions:

### Structural breakages

Using schemas can help us pick up structural changes.
- Protolock for protocol buffers
- json-schema-diff-validator for JSON Schema
- openapi-diff for the OpenAPI specification
- Confluent Schema Registry (supports JSON Schema, Avro, and protocol buffers)

The tool is run in CI environment, it should fail a CI build if incompatible schemas are found, ensuring that your microservice won't get deployed.

### Semantic breakages

Tools like Pact can perform consumer-driven contract testing to to tackle semantic breakages.

If you support multiple client libraries, testing each library with the latest service version can also help.

> [!NOTE]
> Without schemas, testing gets harder and requires extra work to catch breaking changes.


## Semantic Versioning

[Semantic Versioning](../../../development/semver.mdx) can be used to manage changes systematically and communicate compatibility effectively:
- Assign each service a version in format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Increment the `MAJOR` version when introducing backward-incompatible changes, requiring dependent services to adapt.
- Increment the `MINOR` version for new features that maintain backward compatibility.
- Increment the `PATCH` version for bug fixes or minor adjustments that don't impact compatibility.
- Specify the versions of dependent services in your application, ensuring integration works smoothly.

For services with multiple endpoints, consider versioning individual endpoints for ensuring granularity.
