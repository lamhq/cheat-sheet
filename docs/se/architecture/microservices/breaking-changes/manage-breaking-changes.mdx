# Managing Breaking Changes

Three strategies to manage breaking changes in microservices:
1. Lockstep deployment
2. Coexist microservice versions
3. Emulate the old interface


## Lockstep deployment

The updated service and all of its consumers are deployed simultaneously when there're breaking changes.

Lockstep deployment conflict with independent deployability in microservices.

Suitable where:
- same team manages both the microservice and its consumers
- teams can coordinate deployments effectively and ensure synchronized updates

> [!CAUTION]
> Overusing lockstep deployments can lead to a distributed monolith, so it should be used sparingly.


## Coexist microservice versions

Both the old and new versions of the microservice operate concurrently.

Older consumers continue to use the older version, while newer consumers access the new one.

Useful in scenarios where:
- it's crucial to support both older and newer consumers (may be the cost of changing older consumers is too high).
- transit to newer version for a short period (minutes or hours), such as blue-green deployments or canary releases

**Challenges:**
- Requires updating and deploying two service versions, potentially leading to codebase branching issues.
- Complex routing logic to the appropriate microservice, making system behavior harder to understand.
- Managing persistent state across service versions add complexity.

> [!NOTE]
> If the transition of consumers to the new version and its release takes longer, it's more practical to coexist different endpoints within the same microservice, rather than maintaining entirely separate versions.


## Emulate the old interface

Implement the new interface in a new endpoint, but still preserve the existing interface (to maintain backward compatibility) for a transitional period.

Once all the consumers are no longer using the old endpoint, remove it along with any associated code.

**Emulation of old endpoints is the preferred approach**, as the challenges of implementing emulation are generally easier to deal with than coexisting microservice versions.

> [!TIP]
> For systems making use of **HTTP**, choose between version numbers in URI (for example, `/v1/customer` or `/v2/customer`) or request headers for routing, based on your project's needs and client behavior preferences. For **RPC**, methods are put in different namespaces (for example, `v1.createCustomer` and `v2.createCustomer`).


## The social contract

Owner and the consumer need to be clear on:
- How to raise when the interface needs to change?
- How to collaborate to agree on what the change will look like?
- Who will update consumers?
- Timeline for consumers to adopt the new interface.


## Tracking Usage

All endpoints exposed by the microservice must be **logged** to track usage and identify consumers still using the old interface.

A **client identifier** helps teams coordinate migration from the old interface. Consumers can include their identifier in the **user-agent header** when making HTTP requests or use an **API gateway** requiring client keys for identification.


## Extreme Measures

If consumers still do not upgrade even after agreed to do so, **extreme measures** may be considered.

### One-year transition period

One option is retiring old interfaces after a **one-year transition period** without tracking usage.

Responsibility for system failures after the old interface is turned off was shifted to the consuming microservice's team.

This extreme approach can lead to inefficiency, as it lacks active user tracking.


### Slowing down responses

A more drastic approach is **gradually slowing down responses** from the old library, pushing teams toward upgrading. The slowdown increases over time to reinforce the need for migration.
