# User Interface

## Stream-Aligned Teams

A monolithic UI keeps frontend and backend teams siloed, slowing development. 

> [!NOTE]
> "Siloed" refers to teams working in isolation, with limited communication or collaboration between them. They must coordinate constantly, leading to delays and misunderstandings.

Stream-aligned teams, owning end-to-end delivery within a domain, foster direct user connections and better responsiveness. They can be more focused on making sure that the people they are serving are getting what they need.

Backend-only teams risk misunderstanding user needs, leading to implementation issues.


## Dedicated Frontend Teams

Reasons why dedicated frontend teams exist:

### Sharing Specialists

Finding specialists for a specific role is tough (UI designers, iOS, Android, web developers, ...).

Best practices for deploying specialists:
- Embedding them in teams for continuous collaboration.
- Splitting specialist's time across multiple teams if their expertise doesnâ€™t need full-time presence.
- Creating an enabling team to help other teams become self-sufficient.

> [!CAUTION]
> Many organizations place specialists in separate teams, but this creates silos and reduces collaboration.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling teams are specialized teams whose primary role is to support and empower others by providing expertise instead of delivering features. Like an internal consultancy, they guide teams toward self-sufficiency in specific areas.


### Ensuring Consistency

A dedicated frontend team ensures a uniform look and feel across a product (fonts, colors, and interaction patterns).

> [!TIP]
> Organizations can use **enabling teams** and **shared resources** (CSS style guide, UI components) to maintain design consistency.

**Is consistency always necessary?**

Amazon chooses team autonomy over UI consistency. Early versions of Amazon's shopping site had different design styles for various widgets.

AWS prioritizes speed over consistency, and despite UI inconsistencies between its products, it remains a market leader.
