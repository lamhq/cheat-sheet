# Resiliency

## Overview

Refer to [Resiliency Quality Attribute](../../system-design/quality-attributes/resiliency.mdx).


## Patterns

Common resiliency patterns help systems stay responsive and stable even when parts of them fail:

- **Retry**: Automatically reattempt failed requests due to transient issues
- **Timeout**: Limit how long a service waits for a response to avoid hanging
- **Circuit Breaker**: Stop sending requests to a failing service to prevent overload
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate resources so one service’s failure doesn’t affect others
- **Fallback**: Provide alternative logic or default response when a service fails
- **Rate Limiter**: Control the number of requests to prevent overload
- **Health Check**: Monitor service status and trigger recovery mechanisms if needed
- **Fail Fast**: Immediately reject requests when a service is known to be down
- **Load Shedding**: Drop excess requests when the system is under heavy load
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Store failed messages for later inspection or reprocessing
- **Service Mesh Resilience**: Use tools like Istio or Linkerd to manage retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers at the network level
