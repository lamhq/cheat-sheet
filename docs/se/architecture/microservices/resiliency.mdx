# Resiliency

## Stability Patterns

Stability Patterns help make sure that when something fails in a system, it doesn’t break everything else.

## Time-Outs

Time-outs help keep a system responsive and resilient by ensuring that operations don’t hang indefinitely or fail prematurely.

Best practices:

1. Apply time-outs to all calls to external services.
2. Set an overall time-out for an entire operation.
3. Choose a reasonable default time-out.
4. Monitor when time-outs occur and adjust accordingly.
5. Base time-out values on typical response times of downstream services.


## Retries

Retrying failed requests when temporary issues occur can make a lot of sense.

Temporary failures:
- Packet loss: data gets lost in transmission
- High load spikes: a server briefly struggles
- Gateway disruptions: unexpected delays at routing points

Not all failures should trigger a retry. Too many retries can worsen performance rather than fix temporary failures.

Examples:
- 404 Not Found → No retry needed (the resource doesn’t exist)
- 503 Service Unavailable → Retry might be useful (server may be temporarily overloaded)
- 504 Gateway Timeout → Retry might be useful (network delay could resolve itself)

Considerations:
- Introduce a delay before retrying to prevent overwhelming a struggling service.
- Have a time budget for user-facing operations, reduce unnecessary retries.


## Bulkheads

Bulkheads isolate system components so that failures in one area don’t impact others.

Bulkheads help prevent failures rather than just reacting to them, while **time-outs** and **circuit breakers** free up resources when they're constrained.

Examples:
- Separate connection pools for each downstream service: Prevents one failing connection from affecting others.
- Microservice separation: Ensures that an outage in one service doesn’t cascade to others.
- Load shedding: Bulkheads allow systems to reject requests strategically to prevent overload.


## Circuit Breakers

A circuit breaker acts as a protection mechanism that automatically stops requests to a failing service, preventing cascading failures in a system.

If too many requests to a downstream service fail, the circuit breaker "blows" (opens), and all further requests fail fast instead of waiting indefinitely.

### Benefits

- **Prevents system slowdowns:** If a failing service responds slowly, it can impact the entire system. Circuit breakers stop unnecessary requests to that service.
- **Stops unnecessary retries:** Instead of continually sending requests to a broken service, the circuit breaker ensures that requests stop temporarily.
- **Ensures recovery monitoring:** After a set period, the system tests the failed service with a few requests. If responses are healthy, the circuit breaker closes, and normal traffic resumes.


### Implementation

1. Define what counts as a failure (e.g., time-outs or 5XX HTTP errors).
2. Set a threshold for failures before the circuit breaker activates.
3. Allow automatic recovery by periodically testing the service and closing the circuit breaker when it's stable.
4. Consider manual activation for maintenance, preventing unnecessary failures during planned downtime.


## Isolation

Isolation ensures that one service's failure doesn't negatively impact another.

### Benefits

- **Minimizes disruptions**: If a downstream microservice goes offline, upstream services can continue operating if middleware or buffering systems are in place.
- **Increases autonomy**: Isolated services require less coordination between teams, allowing independent development and evolution.
- **Reduces failure spread**: If services run on the same machine or share infrastructure, a failure in one can affect others. Proper isolation ensures failures remain contained.

### Isolation Types

1. **Logical isolation**: Services don't communicate directly, reducing dependency risks.
2. **Physical isolation**: Services run on separate hosts, preventing resource contention (e.g., one service consuming all CPU).
3. **Database isolation**: Each microservice has its own database infrastructure, avoiding shared failures.


### Trade-offs

- **Increased infrastructure costs**: Running services on independent machines requires more resources.
- **Additional complexity**: Managing isolated systems introduces new failure points, such as middleware dependencies.
- **Operational overhead**: More isolated services mean more tools needed for monitoring, scaling, and management.


## Redundancy

Redundancy means having extra copies or instances of a critical component to reduce the risk of failure.

If a microservice instance fails, redundancy ensures another instance is available to continue handling requests.

### Benefits

- **Prevents service disruptions:** If one instance fails, others can take over, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Protects against resource unavailability:** If a critical component (like a database or server) goes offline, redundancy minimizes downtime.
- **Enhances scalability:** Redundant systems not only prevent failures but also help scale workloads efficiently.

### Considerations

- Identify which parts of a system are most vulnerable to failure.
- Prioritize redundancy for components that would severely disrupt operations if they fail.
- More redundancy requires more infrastructure, increasing expenses.


## Idempotency

Idempotency refers to operations that produce the same result no matter how many times they are executed.

Idempotency is a critical principle in designing fault-tolerant, scalable systems, ensuring that retrying operations won’t cause unintended consequences.


### Example

Non-idempotent operation: "Adding Points":
```xml
<credit>
  <amount>100</amount>
  <forAccount>1234</forAccount>
</credit>
```

If processed multiple times, it adds 100 points repeatedly.

An idempotent version, which includes a reference to a specific order:
```xml
<credit>
  <amount>100</amount>
  <forAccount>1234</forAccount>
  <reason>
    <forPurchase>4567</forPurchase>
  </reason>
</credit>
```
This ensures that the points are only applied once for each unique order.


### Benefits

Due to asynchronous processing, there is a small chance that the same message may be processed more than once. By handling events idempotently, duplicate effects are prevented, enhancing system reliability.

> [!CAUTION] For REST API, some HTTP verbs (e.g., GET, PUT) are expected to be idempotent, but this depends on the implementation in the underlying service.
