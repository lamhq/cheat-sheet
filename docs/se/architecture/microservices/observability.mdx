# Observability

## Observability

Observability is about understanding a systemâ€™s internal state from its external outputs.

A highly observable system enables engineers to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

Logs, events, and metrics help increase observability, but focus on making the system understandable rather than excessive tools.


## Monitoring

Monitoring is actively watching a system for predefined issues.

Traditional monitoring sets alerts based on anticipated failures. This approach has limitations in distributed systems where unforeseen issues arise.

> [!TIP]
> Monitoring is something you do, while observability is a property of the system.


## Building Blocks

Building Blocks for Observability:

- **Log aggregation**: Collecting logs from multiple microservices to gain a full picture of system behavior.
- **Metrics aggregation**: Tracking numerical data (CPU usage, response times, etc.) to detect trends and predict issues.
- **Distributed tracing**: Tracking a flow of calls across multiple microservice boundaries to work out what went wrong and derive accurate latency information.
- **Are you doing OK?**: Measuring system reliability (error budgets, SLAs, SLOs) to ensure it's meeting user expectations.
- **Alerting**: Defining meaningful alerts that notify teams about important issues.
- **Semantic monitoring**: Rethinking system health beyond technical metrics (e.g., focusing on user experience).
- **Testing in production**: A summary of various testing in production techniques.
