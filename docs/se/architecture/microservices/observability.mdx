# Observability

## Observability

Observability is about understanding a systemâ€™s internal state from its external outputs.

A highly observable system enables engineers to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

Logs, events, and metrics help increase observability, but focus on making the system understandable rather than excessive tools.


## Monitoring

Monitoring is actively watching a system for predefined issues.

Traditional monitoring sets alerts based on anticipated failures. This approach has limitations in distributed systems where unforeseen issues arise.

> [!TIP]
> Monitoring is something you do, while observability is a property of the system.


## Building Blocks

Building Blocks for Observability:

- **Log aggregation**: Collecting logs from multiple microservices to gain a full picture of system behavior.
- **Metrics aggregation**: Tracking numerical data (CPU usage, response times, etc.) to detect trends and predict issues.
- **Distributed tracing**: Tracking a flow of calls across multiple microservice boundaries to work out what went wrong and derive accurate latency information.
- **Are you doing OK?**: Measuring system reliability (error budgets, SLAs, SLOs) to ensure it's meeting user expectations.
- **Alerting**: Defining meaningful alerts that notify teams about important issues.
- **Semantic monitoring**: Rethinking system health beyond technical metrics (e.g., focusing on user experience).
- **Testing in production**: A summary of various testing in production techniques.


## Tools

**Use Liveness and Readiness Probes**:
- Kubernetes provides liveness and readiness probes that can be used to monitor the health of individual microservices.
- Liveness probes check to see if a microservice is still running, and readiness probes check to see if a microservice is ready to receive traffic.

**Use Monitoring Tools**:
- Monitoring tools can be used to monitor the health and performance of microservices that can be integrated with Kubernetes to provide alerts or notifications when issues arise. I.e. Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog.

**Use Log Analysis Tools**:
- Analyze log messages generated by your microservices and identify issues or trends. Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd, Splunk.

**Set up Alerts and Notifications**:
- Setting up alerts and notifications can help to ensure that relevant parties are notified when issues arise, allowing them to be addressed quickly. Slack, Teams, Email, SMS.
