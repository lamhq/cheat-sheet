# Code Organization

Main approachs for organizing code for microservices:

## One Repo, One Build

A single repository stores all code, with a single build process. Any code check-in triggers a full build that produce multiple artifacts (deployable packages).

### Benefits
- Simple and straightforward approach
- Allows simultaneous changes to multiple services in one commit
- Works well for lockstep releases, where multiple services deploy together

### Downsides
- Even minor changes trigger a full build, causing unnecessary delays
- Difficult to determine which services need deployment, often leading to deploying everything
- A broken build in one service blocks changes across all services
- Ownership becomes unclear when multiple teams collaborate

While technically a form of monorepo, this approach ties all services to a single build, preventing independent deployments. As a result, it's rarely used in practice.


## Multirepo

One Repository per Microservice

Each microservice has its own repository, creating a direct link between code changes and builds. A check-in triggers a build for the affected service, allowing independent deployments and ownership.

### Benefits
- Clear ownership (per repository)
- Independent builds and deployments
- Helps enforce microservice boundaries
- Suitable for teams of all sizes. Prefered when team scales.

### Downsides
- In practice, developers often manage multiple repositories, cross-service changes become painful
- Changes across repos can't be atomic, requiring multiple commits per repository
- Code reuse can be complex if using shared libraries:
  - Updating a library requires publishing a new version, updating dependencies in each service, and deploying affected services
  - Changes can't be rolled out atomically
  - Compatibility checks and deprecation of old library versions can be challenging

> [!CAUTION]
> Frequent cross-service changes may indicate poor service boundaries. In such cases, reconsidering service boundaries or exploring monorepo alternatives might be beneficial.


## Monorepo

A monorepo stores code for multiple microservices in a single repository.

### Build Mapping

Folders in a monorepo are mapped to builds, where changes in a folder trigger the corresponding service build. If changes affect multiple folders, multiple builds are triggered.

For larger projects, graph-based tools like Bazel may be needed for efficient dependency management.

### Code reuse

Monorepos enable finer-grained code reuse, allowing direct dependencies on source files instead of packaging code as a versioned artifacts. However, this causes complex build mapping.

### Defining Ownership

Monorepos work well with small teams but require better tooling as they grow. 

Ownership models range from:
1. **strong ownership**: only designated owners make changes
2. **weak ownership**: outsiders can contribute, but changes must be reviewed and accepted by owners
3. **collective ownership**: anyone can modify code.  

Smaller teams (under 20) can use collective ownership, but larger teams should use strong or weak ownership model to maintain clear responsibilities.

Tools like GitHub's **CODEOWNERS** help define ownership at the directory or file level, code owners are requested for review whenever a pull request is raised for the relevant files.

```
# Owners for all files
*               @team-leads

# Owners for the backend service
backend/        @backend-team

# Owners for the frontend service
frontend/       @frontend-team

# Owners for database migrations
migrations/     @devops-team

# A specific file with an individual owner
config.yaml     @alice
```

### Per-Team Monorepos

Some teams adopt per-team monorepos, where each team fully controls its own repository for all its microservices. While not a traditional monorepo, it retains many of its benefits.

For teams practicing collective ownership, this approach offers advantages while avoiding large-scale challenges. It aligns with organizational boundaries and mitigates concerns about monorepo complexity.


### Benefits
- Enabling atomic commits across multiple services
- Easier code reuse (compared to shared libraries)
- Improved visibility of other service's code

### Downsides
- Deployment complexity. Atomic commits don't guarantee atomic rollouts
- Require complex build mapping. Managing builds across multiple folders requires advanced tooling
- Ownership challenges as team sizes grow, requires tooling
