# Developer Experience

- Developers should only run the microservices they work on in local for fast feedback.
- If a microservice depends on others, use stubs to simulate those dependencies instead of running additional services.

Running microservices in the cloud simplify resources setup but come with challenges:
- Requires constant internet connectivity.
- Can slow down feedback cycles if code changes need frequent cloud updates.
- May increase complexity and costs unnecessarily.
