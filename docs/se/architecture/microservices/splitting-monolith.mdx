# Splitting the Monolith

## Incremental Migration

Migration from monolithic to microservice should be incremental:

1. Start somewhere small. Choose one or two areas of functionality
2. Implement them as microservices
3. Get them deployed into production
4. Reflect on whether creating your new microservices helped you get closer to your end goal.


## What to Split First?

What to split first depends on the balance of **how easy the extraction is** versus **the benefit of extracting**.

1. **Identify Domain Boundaries**: Break down the system by understanding the business domains and subdomains.
1. **Focus on High-Impact Features**: components that are business-critical or need scalability the most
2. **Address Bottlenecks**: areas that consistently cause performance issues.
3. **Most Volatile Features**: Identify areas that change most frequently, see if they would work as microservices. Examples could be pricing modules, promotions, or UI components.
4. **Separate by Data Ownership**: features or modules that manage distinct datasets. For example, splitting the user database functionality from other systems.
5. **Least Coupled Component**: modules or features that have minimal dependencies on other parts of the system. These are easier to decouple.

## Decomposition by Layer

Once you've identified the first microservice to extract, you can break it down further.

In three tiers stack, we can look at its user interface, backend code, and data.

### Decomposing UI

Underestimate the importance of decomposing the UI can lead to disconnected systems.

Decomposing the UI often happens after the backend, but donâ€™t let it fall too far behind.

Splitting the UI can bring big advantages once the microservices are ready.


### Extracting the code first

The code associated with the functionality is extracted into microservice. However, the data remains in the monolithic database.

Extracting application code before data tends to deliver more short-term benefit and it's easier.

If extracting the application code cause major issues, it might be better to stop the process.

If extracting data is impossible, it's important to analyze the system's data storage early in the process. You need to evaluate whether the data can be separated and decide on a clear strategy for the extraction.


### Extracting data first

The data being extracted first, before the application code.

It can be useful in situations in which you are unsure whether the data can be separated cleanly. You want to derisk the full extraction of the microservice.

It forces you to deal up front with issues like loss of enforced data integrity in your database or lack of transactional operations across both sets of data.

It's important to assess whether it's feasible to separate data that is managed within a transaction. If it's too complex now, focus on other system aspects and revisit later.


## Decompositional Patterns

Some usefull decompositional patterns:

### Strangler Fig Pattern

This approach gradually replaces the old system by incrementally transferring its features to the new system.

To do that, you intercept calls to the existing monolithic application:
- If the functionality is implemented in the new microservice, redirected the calls to it.
- otherwise, let the calls continue to the monolith.

Benefits:
- no changes need to be made to the monolithic application
- allow the legacy system to continue functioning while the new system is being built and tested


### Parallel Run

Running both the old monolithic system and the new microservices-based system simultaneously.

They serve the same requests, allowing you to compare results and verify the new system's accuracy.

As confidence in the new system grows, you can incrementally shift more functionality from the monolith to the microservices.

If issues arise in the new system, the old system can continue to operate without disruption.

Particularly useful for critical systems where downtime or errors during migration are unacceptable.


### Feature Toggle

It is a mechanism that allows a feature to be switched off or on, or to switch between two different implementations of some functionality.

> [!TIP]
> With the **strangler fig** pattern that use an HTTP proxy, we could implement the feature toggle in the proxy layer to allow for a simple control to switch between implementations of the functionality in the monolith and the new microservice.


## Concerns

### Performance

Splitting databases apart moves join operations up into the microservices. Microservice has to call other microservices for requesting information.

*For example, when generating the bestsellers report, the Finance microservice need to call the Catalog microservice, requesting product information on each product SKUs*.

*We can mitigate the impact of report generating latency by allowing for SKUs to be looked up in bulk, or cache the product information locally.*

### Data Integrity

You can no longer rely on your database to enforce the integrity of inter-entity relationships for entities stored in multiple microservice

*For instance, a foreign key relationship enables navigation between related tables and prevents deletion of referenced records.*

Work-arounds:
- Use a soft delete to mark a record as deleted without actually removing it.
- Copy the data to another microservice, and synchronize changes in that data.


### Transactions

We lose the safety of the ACID transactions when splitting data across multiple databases


### Tooling

We lack good refactoring-type tooling for changing databases.

There are many tools for managing schema changes in relational database. Schema changes are defined in version-controlled delta scripts and run in strict order in an idempotent manner.


### Reporting Database

There are cases for accessing data from a database rather via an API.

With a reporting database, we create dedicated database for external access, and microservice has to push data to the reporting database.

![](./splitting-monolith/reporting-db.drawio.svg)

Reporting database enables users to execute ad hoc SQL queries, perform large-scale joins, and leverage existing toolchains designed for SQL endpoints.

The reporting database may contain only a subset of the microservice's data (to practice information hiding), customized to meet consumer needs, possibly with a different schema or database technology. Developers of the microservice handle the mapping from internal state to the reporting database.
