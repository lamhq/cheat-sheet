# Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on **testing individual functions or methods** in isolation.

These tests ensure that specific pieces of code work as expected **without external dependencies** such as microservices, databases, or network connections.

Key Characteristics:

- **Small Scope:** They verify a single function or method at a time.
- **Fast Execution:** they run extremely quickly, provide fast feedback.
- **Easy Debugging:** they primarily help developers, as they focus on code correctness rather than business functionality.

Benefits:

- **Bug Detection:** help catch issues early, reducing costly fixes in later development stages.
- **Supports Refactoring:** Developers can confidently restructure code knowing that unit tests will alert them if something breaks.
- **Continuous Integration:** Fast-running unit tests help keep builds efficient, preventing delays caused by broken code.
