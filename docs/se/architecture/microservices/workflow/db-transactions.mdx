# Database Transactions

## Overview

A transaction is a set of actions treated as a single unit, ensuring they occur together and succeed or fail as a whole. 

In databases, transactions guarantee that state changes are successfully applied, or rolled back in case of an error. In relational databases, this could involve multiple tables are being updated within a single transaction.


## Transactions in Microservices

In a microservice architecture, handling database transactions can be challenging because each microservice typically manages its own database, making traditional ACID transactions difficult to implement across multiple services.

For example, consider an e-commerce system with separate microservices for **orders**, **payments**, and **inventory**:
1. A customer places an order, triggering the **Order Service** to create an order entry.
2. The **Payment Service** processes the payment.
3. The **Inventory Service** updates stock levels.

If the payment fails after the order is created, the system must ensure the order is canceled and inventory is restored. Since each service has its own database, traditional transactions cannot guarantee atomicity across them.
