# Database Transactions

## Overview

A transaction is a set of actions treated as a single unit, ensuring they occur together and succeed or fail as a whole. 

In databases, transactions guarantee that state changes are successfully applied, or rolled back in case of an error. In relational databases, this could involve multiple tables are being updated within a single transaction.


## Transactions in Microservices

In a microservice architecture, handling database transactions can be challenging because each microservice typically manages its own database, making traditional ACID transactions difficult to implement across multiple services.
