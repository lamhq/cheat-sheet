# Principles

Principles of Microservice Deployment:

## Isolated execution

- Microservice instances must have their own computing resources
- Their execution cannot impact other microservice instances


## Focus on automation

- Choose technology that allows for a high degree of automation
- Opt for tools that allow automated deployment, database management, and infrastructure adjustments.
- Organizations must prioritize automation to streamline management and reduce operational burden.


## Infrastructure as code

- Configures infrastructure using machine-readable code, ensuring consistency and automation.
- Version controlling your infrastructure code to allow for environments to be re-created and gives transparency over who has made changes.
- Terraform and Pulumi also enable configuring cloud resources. Pulumi allows infrastructure configuration using standard programming languages rather than the domain-specific languages.


## Zero-downtime deployment

- Ensure that deploying a new version of a microservice can be done without any downtime to users of your service (humans or other microservices). Without it, releases may require coordination to inform potential outages
- Using asynchronous communication helps implement Zero-downtime deployment smoothly
- Zero-downtime deployment can be implemented using techniques like rolling upgrades in Kubernetes (gradually replacing instances instead of shutting down). Blue-green deployment is another effective strategy
- Designing microservices with zero-downtime deployment from the start simplifies implementation compared to retrofitting an existing system


## Desired state management

- Use a platform that maintains your microservice in a defined state, launching new instances if required in the event of outages or traffic increases
- This eliminates manual intervention, letting teams focus on defining the desired state instead of managing failures
- Tools like Kubernetes support this concept, as do autoscaling solutions from cloud providers like Azure and AWS.
- Fully automated microservice deployment is essential for leveraging desired state management effectively.
