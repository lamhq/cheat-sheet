# Timeout

## Overview

Timeout Pattern provides that should not wait for a service response for an indefinite amount of time, throw an exception instead of waiting too long.

In microservices, It used to prevent service calls from taking too long to complete.

It sets a maximum time limit for the service call to complete, if the time limit is exceeded, the call is considered to have "timed out".


## Best practices

1. Apply time-outs to all calls to external services.
2. Set an overall time-out for an entire operation.
3. Choose a reasonable default time-out.
4. Monitor when time-outs occur and adjust accordingly.
5. Base time-out values on typical response times of downstream services.
