# Retry

## Overview

The Retry pattern repeats a request if it fails or times out.

It allows a service to handle temporary failures when calling a downstream services.


## Drawbacks

- If a service is **persistently failing** or unavailable for a long time, it leads to an **excessive number of failed requests**, consume resources.
- Too many retries can worsen performance:
  - 404 Not Found → No retry needed (the resource doesn't exist)
  - 503 Service Unavailable → Retry might be useful (server may be temporarily overloaded)
  - 504 Gateway Timeout → Retry might be useful (network delay could resolve itself)


## Best Practices

- Implement additional strategies such as Circuit Breaker or Fallback Logic.
- Introduce a delay before retrying to prevent overwhelming a struggling service.
- Have a time budget for user-facing operations, reduce unnecessary retries.
