# Fallback

## Overview

Fallback Pattern provides an alternative behavior or response if a request fails or times out.

For example:
- use a cached version of the data
- display a default message to the user.
- call a fallback function that provides an alternative response.

In microservices, the fallback pattern help to improve the overall reliability and stability of the system.
