# Redundancy

Redundancy means having extra copies or instances of a critical component to reduce the risk of failure.

If a microservice instance fails, redundancy ensures another instance is available to continue handling requests.

## Benefits

- **Prevents service disruptions:** If one instance fails, others can take over, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Protects against resource unavailability:** If a critical component (like a database or server) goes offline, redundancy minimizes downtime.
- **Enhances scalability:** Redundant systems not only prevent failures but also help scale workloads efficiently.

## Considerations

- Identify which parts of a system are most vulnerable to failure.
- Prioritize redundancy for components that would severely disrupt operations if they fail.
- More redundancy requires more infrastructure, increasing expenses.
