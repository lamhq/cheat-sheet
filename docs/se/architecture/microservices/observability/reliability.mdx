# Measuring System Reliability

## Overview

Traditional monitoring focuses on CPU usage, response times, or uptime, ...

Measuring System Reliability ensure the system meets real user needs, it fully captures whether the system is functioning correctly.


## Service-level agreement

A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between the **system provider** (developers, service operators) and **users** that defines expected performance standards and consequences if those standards aren't met.

Example: AWS EC2 instances have a 90% uptime guarantee, but no assurance beyond that. If an instance fails too often, AWS may refund charges but users still suffer downtime.

Purposes:
- Set expectations for reliability, uptime, and service quality.
- Define compensation or remedies if the service fails to meet its commitments.

SLAs set baseline expectations but may not reflect ideal service performance, users should evaluate real-world reliability beyond just SLA terms.


## Service-Level Objectives

While SLAs set external commitments, SLOs are internal targets that teams aim to meet, ensuring teams work toward high-quality service beyond contractual obligations.

Example: Customer Support Ticket Resolution Time: "Resolve 80% of critical support tickets within 4 hours."

Why SLOs matter?
- They help teams define their own standards for performance.
- Ensuring all teams meet their SLOs will likely satisfy SLAs but also improve overall reliability.
- SLOs may go beyond SLAs, setting aspirational goals or focusing on internal improvements.


## Service-Level Indicator

A Service-Level Indicator (SLI) is a quantitative measure of a system's behavior, used to determine whether SLOs are being met.

Examples:
- **Response time** (e.g., how fast a request is processed).
- **Customer registration success rate** (ensuring users can sign up).
- **Error rate** (how often failures occur).
- **Order completion rate** (tracking successful transactions).

Benefits:
- Without real measurements, teams can't assess whether they are hitting their SLO targets.
- SLIs help organizations optimize performance and ensure reliability.


## Error budgets

Error budgets define the acceptable amount of downtime or failures within a system

For example: If a system has an SLO of 99.9% availability per quarter, it allows up to 2 hours and 11 minutes of downtime. This downtime forms the error budget (the amount of failure a team is allowed before corrective actions are needed).

Using error budgets for decision-making:
- If a team is well below the budget, they can safely experiment (e.g., rolling out a new microservice).
- If they exceed the budget, they should prioritize stability, postponing risky deployments.
