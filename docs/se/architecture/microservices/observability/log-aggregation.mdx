# Log Aggregation

## How it work?

In distributed systems, processes (microservice instances) write logs to local filesystem, a local daemon collects and forwards logs to a centralized storage for querying.

> [!NOTE]
> Before diving into microservices, set up a log aggregation system, it makes debugging and monitoring significantly easier.


## Log Format

Logs should include consistent fields (e.g., date, time, microservice name, log level) to make querying easier.

Avoid reformatting logs during forwarding, because it can be expensive and cause issues. Instead, logs should be properly formatted when created.

Structured formats (like **JSON**) make extracting information easier (e.g., timestamp, service name. log level, customer or order ID) but not human-friendly.


## Correlating log lines

With a large number of services interacting to provide any given end-user capability, each generating separate logs. Without correlation, diagnosing issues across different logs is challenging, and we canâ€™t see the error in the wider context in which it occurs.

Correlation IDs can be useful here. When an initial request is made, a **unique identifier** (correlation ID) is generated and passed through all downstream calls. This ID appears in every related log entry, making it easy to track an issue's full journey.

Benefits:
- Helps group related log entries across services.
- Speeds up troubleshooting by providing full context.
- Enables tracking costly transactions and detecting unexpected behaviors.

Challenges:
- All services must pass the correlation ID consistently, requiring standardization.
- Retrofitting correlation IDs later is difficult, so it's best to implement them early.


## Timing

Log timestamps can be misleading. Each log entry includes a timestamp, but these timestamps are recorded on different machines, which make them logs aren't reliable for ordering events.

Solution: distributed tracing tools track request flows accurately, solving both timing and ordering issues.


## Implementations

Common log aggregation stack:
- Fluentd: A log forwarding agent that collects logs.
- Elasticsearch: A search index for storing and querying logs.
- Kibana: A visualization tool to analyze logs.

Elasticsearch is powerful for log aggregation but has technical and licensing concerns:
- Managing Elasticsearch can be complex, especially if used only for logging.
- It is originally designed as a search index, not a database.
- Elastic switched from an open-source Apache 2.0 license to a Server Side Public License (SSPL).

Alternatives to Elasticsearch & Kibana:
- Splunk: A powerful but very expensive commercial tool.
- Humio & Datadog: Popular alternatives with different capabilities.
- Cloud solutions: AWS CloudWatch & Azure Application Insights provide basic but workable log aggregation.
