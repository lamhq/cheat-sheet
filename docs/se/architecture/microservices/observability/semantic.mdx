# Semantic Monitoring 

Semantic monitoring is a method for assessing system behavior based on predefined expectations rather than just tracking errors.

It works by defining a model for system correctness, establishing key performance criterias (e.g., customers can register, products sell at expected rates, orders ship normally). Criterias are often defined by product owners.

Methods to validate system behavior:
1. **Real user monitoring** – Observing **actual system behavior**, such as sign-ups and sales.
2. **Synthetic transactions** – Simulated operations to proactively **test system behavior** before users encounter problems.
