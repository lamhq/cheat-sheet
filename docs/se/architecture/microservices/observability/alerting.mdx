# Alerting

Alerts must be useful: Too many alerts, or alerts that lack meaningful information, can overwhelm operators.

Guidelines for better alerts (based on EEMUA standards):
- **Relevant** – Alerts should provide valuable information.
- **Unique** – Avoid duplicate alerts that clutter monitoring systems.
- **Timely** – Alerts must arrive quickly enough to be actionable.
- **Prioritized** – Help operators understand which issues need urgent attention.
- **Understandable** – Alerts should be clear and readable.
- **Diagnostic** – Make it obvious what is wrong.
- **Advisory** – Provide guidance on how to fix the problem.
- **Focusing** – Highlight the most important issues.
