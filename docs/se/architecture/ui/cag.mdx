# Central Aggregating Gateway

A Central Aggregating Gateway is an architectural pattern that sits between user interfaces and microservices, helping to filter and combine multiple requests into a single response.

## How it works

1. The UI sends one request to the aggregating gateway.
2. The gateway fetches data from multiple microservices.
3. It combines the results into a single optimized response.
4. The UI receives only the necessary information.

## Benefits

- **Batch requests:** Instead of making separate calls for retrieving data for different items, the gateway processes everything in one batch.
- **Performance boost:** Fewer network calls mean lower bandwidth use and faster responses.
- **Optimized data fetching:** The gateway ensures that the UI only gets relevant information, reducing unnecessary data transmission.


## Ownership

The gateway should be owned by the team(s) creating the UI. This may be impossible if you have a dedicated frontend team, which may not have the skills to build a backend.


## Downsides

### Bottleneck for delivery

The gateway can become a bottleneck for delivery, when multiple teams contribute to it, that require coordination between those teams, slowing things down (the backend for frontend pattern can help resolve this issue).

### Different data requirements

Different **devices** require **different data**:
- **Mobile apps** need fewer API calls to conserve battery and data.
- **Desktop apps** often display **more information** in larger layouts.
- Customer-facing websites, Internal administrations interface, ...

If the same gateway serves both, it may need **separate filtering and aggregating logic** for each client type. Over time, the gateway becomes **bloated** as more APIs are added.

### Complexity

Aside from the call aggregation and filtering, gateways also handle: **API key management**, **User authentication**, **Call routing**. 

If using a third party API gateway solution:
- You may **lose flexibility** since you're tied to the vendor’s toolset.
- Configurations might **limit your ability** to evolve functionality.
- Make sure to have your filtering and aggregation logic elsewhere

If a gateway grows **too complex**, a dedicated team might be needed. Changes require **frontend, gateway, and backend teams** to coordinate—making **development painfully slow**.
