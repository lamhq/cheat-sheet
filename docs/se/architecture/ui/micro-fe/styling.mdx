# Styling

## Requirements

CSS for each Microfrontend should be scoped to that app only.


## CSS Scoping Solutions

### CSS of the project

Custom CSS you write for your project.

1. Use a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components, emotion, etc.)
   - ✅ Safe way to scope CSS
   - ❌ Require a bit of learning-curve, tooling setup.
2. Your framework style scoping solution (Vue, Angular, etc.)
3. Namespace all your CSS by adding a root class.
   - ✅ Easy to set up, using CSS pre-processor (SASS) to automate the prefixing.
   - ❌ Require all members in the team to be aware of the convention, which can be error-prone and risky.


### CSS from third-party libraries

CSS comming from third-party libraries (Bootstrap, Ant Design, etc.).

1. Use a component library that support CSS-in-JS (Material UI)
2. Manually build the css library and apply namespacing techniques to it.
   - ❌ Not easy to do
   - ❌ Still add global classes to the whole website
