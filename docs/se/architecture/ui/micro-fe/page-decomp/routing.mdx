# Routing & Navigation

## How Routing Libraries work

There're two core components implemented in every routing library:

1. **History Object**  
   - Tracks the current path the user is visiting.
   - Can update the path (e.g., when navigating to a new page).
   - Comes in different types:  
     - **Browser History**: Uses the browser’s address bar (e.g., `/marketing/pricing`).  
     - **Hash History**: Uses the hash portion of the URL (e.g., `/#/pricing`).  
     - **Memory History**: Stores the path in memory, not visible in the address bar.

2. **Router**  
   - Decides what content to show based on the current path from the history object.


## Requirements

1. Microfrontends can add/remove pages/routes any time. This shoudn't require redeploying the shell app.
2. Navigation should work when running Microfrontends inside the shell app and in isolation (development).
3. Routing mechanism should allow showing multiple Microfrontends at the same time.
4. Use the existing routing libraries, don't build your own (e.g., React Router, Vue Router, etc).
5. Different Microfrontends can use different routing libraries.
6. Not all Microfrontends require navigation.


## Solution

1. The shell app only decide which Microfrontend to load. Each Microfrontend will decide which page to show.
2. The shell app uses **browser history** to control the main URL.
3. Each Microfrontend uses **memory history** to manage its own internal routing and sync their internal paths with the shell app.

Using browser history in multiple apps can cause:
- ❌ Conflicting updates to the address bar.
- ❌ Race conditions between different routing libraries.
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior due to different implementations of browser history


## Syncing History

To sync history of each Microfrontend with the shell app:

1. The shell app provides a callback function to each Microfrontend via its `render()` method.
2. Upon navigation, the Microfrontend invokes this callback with the updated path to keep the shell app in sync.

```js title="shell/src/bootstrap.js"
import { render } from '...';

export default function MarketingApp() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    render(ref.current, {
      // callback function to be called when the Microfrontend navigates
      onMfeNavigate: ...,
    });
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref} />;
}
```


To sync history of the shell app to Microfrontend:

1. The shell app passes the current path to the Microfrontend via the `render()` function as the initial path.  
2. The `render()` function returns a callback that the shell app invokes whenever its history changes.

```js title="shell/src/bootstrap.js"
import { render } from '...';
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

export default function MarketingApp() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    const { onShellNavigate } = render(ref.current, {
      initialPath: location.pathname,
    });
  }, []);

  return <div ref={ref} />;
}
```
