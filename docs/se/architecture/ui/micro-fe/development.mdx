# Development

How Microfrontends should be developed.

## Requirements

- Each microfrontend should be able to run locally on its own dev server. No need to spin up the entire application to develop or test a single microfrontend.
- The shell app should be able to consume remote modules exposed by Microfrontends during local development.
- Ensure changes in microfrontends reflect instantly in the host app (Hot Module Replacement).
