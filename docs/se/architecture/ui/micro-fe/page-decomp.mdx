# Page-Based Decomposition

## Overview

The web application is divided into distinct applications, each responsible for rendering pages belong to its own feature.

- The decomposition is done at the page level.
- A shell app loads the correct Microfrontend based on the route prefix.
- Each Microfrontend is responsible for its own routing, logic, and rendering for its page.

For example, consider a web app with multiple pages:
- `/products/*` → Product Catalog App
- `/categories/*/products` → Product Catalog App
- `/cart/*` → Shopping Cart App
- `/checkout/*` → Checkout App


## Benefits

- **Clear ownership**: Each team owns a full page, making development and deployment easier.
- **Simplified Integration**: there's less need for deep UI coordination when working with pages.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale development across large teams or organizations.
- **Isolation**: Fewer cross-team dependencies; easier to test and maintain.


## Challenges

- **Limited composition**: Harder to mix UI from multiple apps on the same page (for example, a dashboard).
- **Redundant code**: Shared widgets may be duplicated across pages (tag list, search bar, etc).


## Where to Use It?

- Large applications with clearly separated features.
- Organizations with multiple teams working on different distinct parts of the app.
