# Monolithic Frontend

## Overview

The Monolithic Frontend pattern refers to a traditional architecture where the entire frontend of an application is built, maintained, and deployed as a single codebase.

This pattern is commonly used in single-page applications (SPAs), often developed by a dedicated frontend team.


## How It Works?

1. The UI independently handles its state and logic.
2. It requests data from Microservices.
3. The Microservices return data in JSON format, which is used to display in the UI.


## Benefits

- Easier to set up for small teams or MVPs.
- Simplified tooling and configuration.
- Straightforward testing and debugging.


## Drawbacks

- **Difficult to scale**: If multiple teams need to work on the frontend, there can be conflicts.
- **Limited customization**: The UI cannot easily tailor responses for different devices (e.g., a mobile app may receive too much unnecessary data).
- **Layered architecture risk**: If multiple teams work on different layers, this can make communication and coordination difficult.


## When to use?
- Ideal when you want all frontend logic in one deployable unit.
- Works well for a single team developing both the frontend and microservices.


## Alternatives

- **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)**: Creates separate backends for different UI types.
- **GraphQL**: Enables more flexible queries, allowing clients to request only the data they need.
