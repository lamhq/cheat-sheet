# Micro Frontends

## Overview

The micro frontend pattern is an approach that divides a monolithic frontend application into multiple smaller applications, with each one responsible for a distinct feature or section of the product.


## Example

Imagine an online store with:
- A **Product Listing Page**
- A **Shopping Cart Page**

In a traditional setup, both features live inside one big codebase (a monolithic Single Page Application).

With Microfrontends:
- The **Product Listing** becomes its own standalone app.
- The **Shopping Cart** becomes another separate app.
- Each app can be built using different frameworks (e.g., React for one, Angular for the other).
- They communicate indirectly via APIs, not directly with each other.


## Key Characteristics

- **Feature Isolation**: Each Microfrontend handles one major feature.
- **Independent Deployment**: Teams can deploy their parts without affecting others.
- **Tech Flexibility**: Different teams can use different tools or frameworks.
- **No Direct Communication**: Apps interact through shared APIs, not internal calls.


## Benefits

- **Isolation**: Multiple teams can work in parallel without stepping on each other’s toes.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller apps are easier to understand and modify.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale development across large organizations.
- **Resilience**: One app breaking doesn’t necessarily crash the whole system.


## Challenges

- **Consistent User Experience**. Maintaining a unified look and feel across microfrontends requires strict design guidelines and shared component libraries.
- **Handling shared dependencies**. Shared dependencies can lead to bundle bloat if not handled carefully.


## When to use?

- When the frontend becomes too large for a single team to manage effectively.
- When teams want independent ownership over their UI components.


## Terms

- **Microfrontend**: A small, self-contained, and independently deployable part of a web application's user interface.
- **Shell Application (or Host)**: The main application that loads and orchestrates microfrontends.
- **Integration**: The process of composing multiple microfrontends into a single, cohesive user experience.


## Implementation

Approaches to implement Micro Frontend:

1. **Page-based decomposition**: The frontend is split into separate pages managed by different teams.
2. **Widget-based decomposition**: Different UI components are assembled onto a single screen.
