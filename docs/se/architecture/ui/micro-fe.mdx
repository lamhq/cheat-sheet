# Micro Frontends

## Overview

The micro frontend pattern is an approach that allows different parts of a frontend to be built and deployed independently.

It's similar to microservices work in the backend, allowing for flexibility, scalability, and faster development.


## How it works?

- The frontend is split into smaller independently deployable applications.
- Each team manages both the backend microservices and the corresponding UI components.
- This solves problems caused by large, monolithic single-page applications (SPAs), where a tightly coupled frontend can slow down development.


## Implementation

Approaches to implement Micro Frontend:

1. **Widget-based decomposition**: Different UI components are assembled onto a single screen.
2. **Page-based decomposition**: The frontend is split into separate pages managed by different teams.


## When to use

- When teams want independent ownership over their UI components.
- If you want to avoid a layered architecture, which can create rigid organizational silos.
- When the frontend becomes too large for a single team to manage effectively.

## Challenges

- Some microservices donâ€™t fit neatly into widgets or pages. For example, a recommendation system may need to dynamically interact with different parts of the UI.
- Highly interconnected features may require traditional API calls rather than strict micro frontend separation.
