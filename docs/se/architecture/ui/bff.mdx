# Backend for Frontend (BFF)

The Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern is similar to Central Aggregating Gateway, but it creates a dedicated backends for each UI type (or user experience).

Each UI has its own BFF, owned by the same team, making it easier to define and adapt the API as the UI requires.

BFF make coupling more acceptable by reducing sharing ownership between teams, avoids bottleneck for development.

The UI is divided into two parts:
- Client-side (e.g., web frontend or mobile app).
- Server-side BFF, which acts as a middle layer between the UI and microservices. The BFF fetches and processes data, ensuring the UI gets only what it needs.


## Code reuse

Having one BFF per user interface can end up with lots of duplication among the BFFs: same types of aggregation, same code for interfacing with downstream services, ...

Solutions:
- Avoid extracting duplicated code to a Shared Library, as it can introduce strong coupling, making upgrades difficult.
- If duplicated logic is business-related, creating a dedicated microservice can be a better approach.

A good rule of thumb: Only abstract shared functionality when you're implementing it a third time.


## When to use

Useful when different user interfaces (e.g., web and mobile) require unique backend logic tailored to their needs

If your application only provides a web UI, a BFF may not be necessary unless there is significant data aggregation required on the server side.

For mobile apps, they require optimized API calls and less data, a BFF ensures the backend delivers only what the mobile client needs.

If frontend developers and backend teams are highly separated, a BFF ensures that frontend teams maintain control over their API needs without relying heavily on backend teams for modifications.


## Implementation

We can use GraphQL to implement an aggregating gateway, or even a BFF. 

GraphQL allows easily change the aggregation and filtering by changing the query from client, no changes required to the GraphQL server, which means less chance of your GraphQL server becoming a shared, contended resource

> [!NOTE]
> Server-side changes will still be needed if you need to expose new types or add fields to existing types.
