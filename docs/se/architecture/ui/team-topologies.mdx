# Team Topologies

Different approach for organizing frontend teams:

## Layered Teams

A traditional structure, where teams are divided by technical layer (aka, Siloed teams).

For example, one team handles frontend (UI/UX), another handles backend (APIs, databases).

Pros:
- Easier to manage technical consistency within a layer.

Cons:
- High coordination overhead. These teams must constantly coordinate, which slows things down and leads to miscommunication.
- Slower delivery due to cross-team dependencies.
- Risk of mismatched features. Backend-only teams may not fully understand what users actually need.


## Stream-Aligned Teams

A stream-aligned team is a cross-functional group that owns **end-to-end delivery** of a specific product or domain.

For example, one team might own everything related to the "Shopping Cart" feature—UI, backend, data, and user feedback.

Pros:
- **Closer to the user**. They can respond faster to feedback and build what actually matters.
- **No cross-team dependencies**. They don’t need to wait for another team to make backend changes or UI updates, leading to faster delivery, fewer misunderstandings.


## Dedicated Frontend Teams

### Sharing Specialists

Dedicated frontend teams exist because finding specialists for a specific role is tough (UI designers, iOS, Android, web developers, ...).

Best practices for deploying specialists:
- Embedding them in teams for continuous collaboration.
- Splitting specialist's time across multiple teams if their expertise doesn't need full-time presence.
- Creating an **enabling team** to help other teams become self-sufficient.

> [!CAUTION]
> Many organizations place specialists in separate teams, but this creates silos and reduces collaboration.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling teams are specialized teams whose primary role is to support and empower others by providing expertise instead of delivering features. Like an internal consultancy, they guide teams toward self-sufficiency in specific areas.


### Ensuring Consistency

A dedicated frontend team ensures a uniform look and feel across a product (fonts, colors, and interaction patterns).

> [!TIP]
> Organizations can use **enabling teams** and **shared resources** (CSS style guide, UI components) to maintain design consistency.

**Is consistency always necessary?**

Amazon chooses team autonomy over UI consistency. Early versions of Amazon's shopping site had different design styles for various widgets.

AWS prioritizes speed over consistency, and despite UI inconsistencies between its products, it remains a market leader.
