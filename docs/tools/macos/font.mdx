## Installing Fonts

Font Book is the default font management application in macOS.

To install fonts for current user using Font Book:

1.  **Download the font file:** Obtain the font file(s) in a supported format. macOS supports:
    * TrueType (.ttf)
    * TrueType Collection (.ttc)
    * OpenType (.otf)
    * OpenType-SVG (.otf)
2.  **Open Font Book:** You can find it in the **Applications** folder or by using Spotlight search (Command + Space, then type "Font Book").
3.  **Install the font:** In the Font Book app, go to **File > Add Fonts to Current User**. In the window that appears, double-click the font file.

The font will be installed in `~/Library/Fonts/`
   

## Managing Fonts

Font Book allows you to manage your installed fonts:

* **Previewing Fonts:** Select a font in the Font Book list to see a preview of its characters. Double-click a font for a more detailed preview and to see all available glyphs.
* **Validating Fonts:** To check for errors or corruption in a font:
    1.  Select a font (or multiple fonts).
    2.  Go to **File > Validate Selection** (or **File > Validate File** to choose a font file in Finder).
    3.  Review the results in the Font Validation window. A green icon indicates the font passed, yellow indicates a warning, and red indicates a failure. You can remove failed fonts from this window.
* **Resolving Duplicate Fonts:** Font Book automatically checks for duplicates during installation. You can also manually check by going to **File > Resolve Duplicates**.
* **Deactivating/Activating Fonts:** If you don't want to delete a font but want to temporarily prevent it from being used, you can deactivate it. Select the font(s) and go to **Edit > Deactivate**. Deactivated fonts appear dimmed in the Font Book list.
* **Organizing Fonts with Collections and Libraries:**
    * **Collections:** Allow you to group fonts for specific projects or purposes without moving the actual font files. To create a collection, go to **File > New Collection** or select fonts and go to **File > New Collection From Selection**.
    * **Smart Collections:** Automatically update based on criteria you set (e.g., all bold fonts). Go to **File > New Smart Collection**.
    * **Libraries:** Separate databases of fonts. This is useful for organizing large font archives. Go to **File > New Library** and then add fonts to the library (**File > Add Fonts to [Library Name]**). Libraries are not shown in the standard font menus of applications.
