## What is ngrok?

ngrok (pronounced as _en-grok_) is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel to your local web server.

## Use Cases

### Development and Testing

**Webhook Testing**:
- Run ngrok on your local machine to get a URL to receive
  webhooks directly in the app you're developing.
- Inspect and replay requests for fast development.

**Local Previews**:
- Demo a website running on your local machine to a client
  or stakeholder without deploying to a staging site.

**Mobile Backend Testing**:
- Test your mobile apps against a backend that
  you're developing on your local machine.

### Remote Access

You can securely access machines and services like SSH or RDP over the internet using ngrok’s TCP endpoints.

### Production Ingress

Ngrok provides a unified platform for secure, scalable ingress including reverse proxy, load balancing, and identity-aware access.

### Ingress to External Networks

You can securely access APIs in customer environments or remote networks without needing VPNs or complex setups.
