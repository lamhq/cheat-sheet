# Dev Containers

Using docker container as your development environment.

## Overview

The VS Code [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension helps creating a full-featured development environment by including project's dependencies, and all necessary tools (database, ) into one tidy container. 

The extension lets you open your project inside (or mounted into) the container in VS Code, where you have all the dependencies and software set up.


## Benefits

Ensure that your development environment closely mirrors the production environment.

Easy to reproduce the same environment across different machines.

Isolating dependencies and avoiding conflicts between different software versions.

Avoid messing up your machine.


## Drawbacks

Slower than running project/software directly on your machine.

Consume more power and resources on your laptop.


## Use cases

You have to work on multiple projects with different tech stacks and software (Python, Node.js, Postgres, MongoDB, ...)

You need to switch between machine (home computer, laptop, ...)

There are so many software programs to install, and they are time-consuming.

Build and install packages for runtime environments.


## Requirements
