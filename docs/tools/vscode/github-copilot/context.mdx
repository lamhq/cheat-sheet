# Add context

## Implicit context

The following information is **implicitly** included in the chat context:
- Current selected text.
- The file name of the active editor.
- The active file (**Ask** or **Edit**)


## # - mention

Use `#` to mention different types of context items or invoke tools. Examples:
- `Explain how authentication works in #codebase`
- `Summarize #fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates`
- `How does routing work? #githubRepo vercel/next.js`
- `How do I use the 'useState' hook in react 18? #fetch https://18.react.dev/reference/react/useState#usage`
- `what are my open issues #github-mcp`
- `Fix the issues in #problems`
- `Summarize the #changes`

### Getting context

- Search files in workspace: `#fileSearch <query>`
- Search code from GitHub: `#githubRepo <repo>`
- Fetch web content: `#fetch <URL>`
- Add files/folders as context: use `#file` or Drag & drop from Explorer view
- Search codebase for context: `#codebase <keyword?>`
- Get current selected code: `#selection`
- Get search results from the Search view: `#searchResults`
- Get workspace issues and problems (from the Problems panel): `#problems`

### Unit test

- Run unit tests in the workspace: `#runTests <keyword>`
- Fix test failures: `Fix the failing tests #testFailure`

### Terminal

- Enable running commands in the terminal and reading the output: `#runCommands`
- Run a shell command in the integrated terminal: `#runInTerminal <command>`
- Get the current terminal selection: `#terminalSelection`

### VS Code

- Search extension: `#extensions <query>`
- Install extension: `#installExtension <query>`
- Ask about VS Code functionality: `#vscodeAPI <query>`

### Scaffolding

- Ask instructions for scaffolding new projects: `#getProjectSetupInfo <keyword>`
- Scaffold a new VS Code workspace, preconfigured with debug and run configurations: `#new`, `#newWorkspace`

### Other

- Run a task in an isolated subagent context, avoid polluting the context of the main agent: `#runSubagent <task>`
- Track implementation and progress of a chat request with a todo list: `#todos`
- Find usage of a symbol (function, class, variable, etc.): `#usages <symbol>`


## @ - mention

Use `@` to mention chat participants to ask questions belong to a specific domain.

Built-in chat participants:
### `@github`

Ask questions about GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and [more](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/chat-in-ide#using-github-skills-for-copilot).

- `@github What are all of the open PRs assigned to me?`
- `@github Show me the recent merged PRs from @dancing-mona`

### `@terminal`

Ask questions about the integrated terminal or shell commands.

> Example: @terminal list the 5 largest files in this workspace

- `@vscode`: ask questions about VS Code features, settings, and the VS Code extension APIs.

> Example: @vscode how to enable word wrapping?

- `@workspace`: Ask questions about the current workspace.

> Example: @workspace how is authentication implemented?

Examples:

- `@vscode how to enable word wrapping`
- `@terminal what are the top 5 largest files in the current directory`


## / - command

Use `/` command to access common commands (`/new`, `/explain`, ... or custom prompts).

- `/doc`: Generate code documentation comments from editor inline chat.
- `/explain`: Explain a code block, file, or programming concept.
- `/fix`: Ask to fix a code block or resolve compiler or linting errors.
- `/tests`: Generate tests for all or only the selected methods and functions in the editor.
- `/setupTests`: Get help setting up a testing framework for your code. Get recommendation for a relevant testing framework, steps to set up and configure it, and suggestions for VS Code testing extensions.
- `/clear`: Start a new chat session in the Chat view.
- `/new`: Scaffold a new VS Code workspace or file. Use natural language to describe the type of project/file you need, and preview the scaffolded content before creating it.
- `/newNotebook`: Scaffold a new Jupyter notebook based on your requirements. Use natural language to describe what the notebook should contain.
- `/search`: Generate a search query for the Search view. Use natural language to describe what you want to search for.
- `/startDebugging`: Generate a launch.json debug configuration file and start a debugging session from the Chat view.
- `/prompt name`: Run a reusable prompt in chat.


## Images

You can drag and drop an image from a web browser or file system onto the Chat view to add it as context.

For examples:

- Attach a screenshot of a block of code and ask to explain it
- Attach a sketch of a UI and ask the agent to implement it


## Browser Elements

You can add elements from the [Simple Browser window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context#_add-browser-elements-experimental) as context to your chat prompt.

> [!INFO]
> VS Code has a built-in browser that you can use to preview and interact with web pages inside VS Code.

To do that:

1. Enable selection from the Simple Browser with the `chat.sendElementsToChat.enabled` setting.
2. Start your web application.
3. Open the Simple Browser view by running the Simple Browser: Show command from the Command Palette.
4. Select the Start button to start selecting elements from the current page.
5. Hover over the elements of the web page and click to add them to the chat prompt.
