# Modes

Three distinct modes of GitHub Copilot: ask, edit, and agent.

## Ask mode

Ask mode is the simplest and fastest way to get answers to programming questions without modifying your code.

It use context of your current editor environment (current opening files, selected code block, chat history).

**To use it**:
1. Highlight some code
2. Type a question into Copilot Chat
3. Copilot will generate an answer

**When to use**:
- Quick explanation of a code block
- Suggestions for testing
- General programming knowledge (e.g., how to use a library)


## Edit mode

Edit mode allows you to describe a desired update in natural language, and Copilot will apply inline, review-ready code edits across selected files.

You can use custom instructions to define code standards and style preferences, ensuring the generated code aligns with your team's playbook.

**When to use**: implementing small changes or refactoring with surgical precision


## Agent mode

The most powerful mode, Copilot autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks across your entire project.

Agent mode analyzes related code, identifies additional changes that may be required, and applies them across the project to keep everything consistent.

Similar to Edit mode, you can use custom instructions to specify code standards, structure, and guidelines to shape how Copilot behaves across a session.

**When to use**:
- Tackling complex tasks across multiple files and steps
- Implementing a new feature
- Fixing bugs
- Scaffold an entire section of an app
