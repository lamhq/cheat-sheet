# Chat

## Overview

Chat in Visual Studio Code enables you to start an AI chat conversation. You can:
- Ask questions about your code
- Scaffold new projects
- Generate new features
- Fix bugs
- Run test and fix test failures
- ...


## Accessing Chat

To access Chat, use the Chat menu in the VS Code title bar:

### Inline chat

Press `⌘I` (Command + I) to open Inline Chat in the **editor** or **integrated terminal**.

Prompt is scoped to the code in the active editor.

Use inline chat for:

- Getting suggestions inline, right where you're working
- Understanding code in your current context
- Getting help with terminal commands and output

### Quick chat

Press `⇧⌥⌘L` (Command + Option + Shift + L) to open a lightweight chat overlay.

Use quick chat for:

- Quick questions that don't require extended conversation
- Getting answers without changing your current view
- Looking up information while maintaining focus on your work

### Chat view

Press `⌃⌘I` (Control + Command + I) to open the Chat view.

Use the Chat view for:

- Ongoing, multi-turn chat conversations
- Switching between different agents to ask questions, make code edits across files, or start autonomous coding workflows
- Working on features that span multiple files
- Planning and implementing complex changes

## Chat modes

Three distinct modes of Chat view: ask, edit, and agent.

### Ask mode

Get answers without modifying code.

It use context of your current editor environment (current opening files, selected code block, chat history).


### Edit mode

Do small code changes across selected files.

You can use custom instructions to define code standards and style preferences, ensuring the generated code aligns with your team's playbook.


### Agent mode

Plan and execute multi-step tasks across your entire project.

Custom instructions can be used as guidelines to shape how Copilot behaves across a session.

**When to use**:
- Tackling complex tasks across multiple files and steps
- Implementing a new feature
- Fixing bugs
- Scaffold an entire section of an app


## Use tools in chat

Tools extend chat in Visual Studio Code with specialized functionality. They can:
- search code
- run commands
- fetch web content
- invoke APIs
- ...

### Usage

To use tools in Chat, type `#` followed by a **tool name**:
- `Summarize the content from #fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates`
- `How does routing work in Next.js? #githubRepo vercel/next.js`
- `Fix the issues in #problems`
- `Explain the authentication flow #codebase`

Some tools accept parameters. For example, `#fetch` requires a URL and `#githubRepo` requires a repository name.

You can enable or disable tools on a per-request basis by using the tools picker:

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat-tools/agent-mode-select-tools.png)

When using agents, it autonomously chooses and invokes relevant tools as needed to accomplish the task.

### Types

VS Code supports three types of tools:
- **Built-in tools**. See [Chat tools reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-vscode-features#_chat-tools) for a complete list.
- **MCP tools**. MCP servers provide tools that extend chat with extra capabilities. MCP servers can run locally on your machine or be hosted remotely.
- **Extension tools**. Extensions can provide tools that integrate deeply with the editor using VS Code extension APIs.

You can add more tools by [installing MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) or [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions) that contribute tools.


### Auto approve tool

You can choose to automatically approve tool by change `chat.tools.eligibleForAutoApproval` setting to `true`.

To auto approve all requests to an URL, configure the `chat.tools.urls.autoApprove` setting:

```json
{
  "chat.tools.urls.autoApprove": {
    "https://www.example.com": false,
    "https://*.contoso.com/*": true,
    "https://example.com/api/*": {
        "approveRequest": true,
        "approveResponse": false
    }
  }
}
```

To auto approve tools to edit files, use the chat.tools.edits.autoApprove setting:

```json
{
  "chat.tools.edits.autoApprove": {
    "**/*": true,
    "**/.vscode/*.json": false,
    "**/.env": false
  }
}
```

You can configure which terminal commands are automatically approved by using the `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` setting:

```json
{
  // Allow the `mkdir` command
  "mkdir": true,
  // Allow `git status` and commands starting with `git show`
  "/^git (status|show\\b.*)$/": true,

  // Block the `del` command
  "del": false,
  // Block any command containing "dangerous"
  "/dangerous/": false
}
```

Related settings:

- `chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove`: permanently disable auto-approve functionality
- `chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites` (experimental): detection of file writes (experimental)
- `chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules` (experimental): disable all default rules (both allow and block), giving full control over all rules.

To clear all saved tool approvals, use the `Chat: Reset Tool Confirmations` command in the Command Palette.

> [!CAUTION]
> To allow all tools and terminal commands to run without prompting for user confirmation, enable the `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` setting.


## Export a chat session

Export a chat session as a JSON file by running the `Chat: Export Chat...` command from the Command Palette.


## Save a chat session as a prompt

You can save a chat session as a prompt to reuse by typing `/savePrompt` command in the chat.

> [!INFO]
> The command creates a prompt file that generalizes your current chat conversation into a reusable prompt. The prompt file has placeholders where appropriate.


## Use Subagents

A subagent is an isolated, autonomous agent within a chat session.

It handle a specific task and has its own context, operate independently from the main chat. 

It helps optimize context management for complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., research, analysis) by returning only the final result to the main chat session, keeping the main context window focused on the primary conversation.

To invoke a subagent in a prompt:

1. In the tool picker, enable **Built-In** > **Agent** > **runSubagent** tool
2. In chat, ask to use subagent: 
   - `Run #runSubagent to research the best authentication methods for web applications. Summarize the findings.`

> [!INFO]
> You can [specify a custom agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-sessions#_use-a-custom-agent-with-subagents-experimental) to use with subagents.
