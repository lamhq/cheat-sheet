# Chat

VS Code provides three ways to start an AI chat conversation, to access them, use the Chat menu in the VS Code title bar:

## Chat view

Press `⌃⌘I` (Control + Command + I) to open the Chat view.

Use the Chat view for:

- Ongoing, multi-turn chat conversations
- Switching between different agents to ask questions, make code edits across files, or start autonomous coding workflows
- Working on features that span multiple files
- Planning and implementing complex changes

## Inline chat

Press `⌘I` (Command + I) to open Inline Chat in the **editor** or **integrated terminal**.

Prompt is scoped to the code in the active editor.

Use inline chat for:

- Getting suggestions inline, right where you're working
- Understanding code in your current context
- Getting help with terminal commands and output

## Quick chat

Press `⇧⌥⌘L` (Command + Option + Shift + L) to open a lightweight chat overlay.

Use quick chat for:

- Quick questions that don't require extended conversation
- Getting answers without changing your current view
- Looking up information while maintaining focus on your work

## Add context

The following information is **implicitly** included in the chat context:
- Current selected text.
- The file name of the active editor.
- The active file (**Ask** or **Edit**)


### # - mention

Use `#` to mention different types of context items:

- Files/folders: `#file` or Drag & drop from Explorer view
- Codebase: `#codebase` (enable code search for your workspace)
- Terminal output: `#terminalSelection`
- Code symbols (make sure to open the file containing the symbol in the editor first)
- Tools: `#` followed by a **tool name**
- Content from web: `#fetch <URL>`
- Content from GitHub: `#githubRepo <repo>`

Examples:

- `Explain how authentication works in #codebase`
- `Summarize #fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates`
- `How does routing work? #githubRepo vercel/next.js`
- `How do I use the 'useState' hook in react 18? #fetch https://18.react.dev/reference/react/useState#usage`
- `what are my open issues #github-mcp`
- `Fix the failing tests #testFailure`
- `Fix the issues in #problems`
- `Summarize the #changes`


### @ - mention

Use `@` to mention chat participants to ask questions belong to a specific domain.

VS Code has several built-in chat participants like `@vscode`, `@terminal`, or `@workspace`.

Examples:

- `@vscode how to enable word wrapping`
- `@terminal what are the top 5 largest files in the current directory`


### / - command

Use `/` command to access common commands (`/new`, `/explain`, ... or custom prompts).


### Images

You can drag and drop an image from a web browser or file system onto the Chat view to add it as context.

For examples:

- Attach a screenshot of a block of code and ask to explain it
- Attach a sketch of a UI and ask the agent to implement it


### Browser Elements

You can add [elements from the Simple Browser window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context#_add-browser-elements-experimental) as context to your chat prompt. VS Code has a built-in browser that you can use to preview and interact with web pages inside VS Code.

To do that:

1. Enable selection from the Simple Browser with the `chat.sendElementsToChat.enabled` setting.
2. Start your web application.
3. Open the Simple Browser view by running the Simple Browser: Show command from the Command Palette.
4. Select the Start button to start selecting elements from the current page.
5. Hover over the elements of the web page and click to add them to the chat prompt.


## Use tools in chat

Tools can:
- search code
- run commands
- fetch web content
- invoke APIs

VS Code supports three types of tools:
- **Built-in tools**. See [Chat tools reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/copilot-vscode-features#_chat-tools) for a complete list.
- **MCP tools**. MCP servers provide tools that extend chat with extra capabilities. MCP servers can run locally on your machine or be hosted remotely.
- **Extension tools**. Extensions can provide tools that integrate deeply with the editor using VS Code extension APIs.

You can enable or disable tools on a per-request basis by using the tools picker.

You can add more tools by [installing MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) or [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions) that contribute tools.

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat-tools/agent-mode-select-tools.png)

When using agents, it autonomously chooses and invokes relevant tools as needed to accomplish the task.

You can explicitly reference tools in prompts by typing `#` followed by the tool name:
- "Summarize the content from #fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates"
- "How does routing work in Next.js? #githubRepo vercel/next.js"
- "Fix the issues in #problems"
- "Explain the authentication flow #codebase"

Some tools accept parameters. For example, `#fetch` requires a URL and `#githubRepo` requires a repository name.

## Auto approve

You can choose to automatically approve tool by change `chat.tools.eligibleForAutoApproval` setting to `true`.

To auto approve all requests to an URL, configure the `chat.tools.urls.autoApprove` setting:

```json
{
  "chat.tools.urls.autoApprove": {
    "https://www.example.com": false,
    "https://*.contoso.com/*": true,
    "https://example.com/api/*": {
        "approveRequest": true,
        "approveResponse": false
    }
  }
}
```

To auto approve tools to edit files, use the chat.tools.edits.autoApprove setting:

```json
{
  "chat.tools.edits.autoApprove": {
    "**/*": true,
    "**/.vscode/*.json": false,
    "**/.env": false
  }
}
```

You can configure which terminal commands are automatically approved by using the `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` setting:

```json
{
  // Allow the `mkdir` command
  "mkdir": true,
  // Allow `git status` and commands starting with `git show`
  "/^git (status|show\\b.*)$/": true,

  // Block the `del` command
  "del": false,
  // Block any command containing "dangerous"
  "/dangerous/": false
}
```

Related settings:

- `chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove`: permanently disable auto-approve functionality
- `chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites` (experimental): detection of file writes (experimental)
- `chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules` (experimental): disable all default rules (both allow and block), giving full control over all rules.

To clear all saved tool approvals, use the `Chat: Reset Tool Confirmations` command in the Command Palette.

> [!CAUTION]
> To allow all tools and terminal commands to run without prompting for user confirmation, enable the `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` setting.


## Export a chat session

Export a chat session as a JSON file by running the `Chat: Export Chat...` command from the Command Palette.


## Save a chat session as a prompt

You can save a chat session as a prompt to reuse by typing `/savePrompt` command in the chat.

> [!INFO]
> The command creates a prompt file that generalizes your current chat conversation into a reusable prompt. The prompt file has placeholders where appropriate.


## Use Subagents

A subagent is an isolated, autonomous agent within a chat session.

It handle a specific task and has its own context, operate independently from the main chat. 

It helps optimize context management for complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., research, analysis) by returning only the final result to the main chat session, keeping the main context window focused on the primary conversation.

To invoke a subagent in a prompt:

1. In the tool picker, enable **Built-In** > **Agent** > **runSubagent** tool
2. In chat, ask to use subagent: `Run #runSubagent to research the best authentication methods for web applications. Summarize the findings.`

> [!INFO]
> You can [specify a custom agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-sessions#_use-a-custom-agent-with-subagents-experimental) to use with subagents.
