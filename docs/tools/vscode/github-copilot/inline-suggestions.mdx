## Find matching code

How to find references to publicly available code when GitHub Copilot suggests a completion that matches it.

This feature is only available if your GitHub Copilot settings (personal or organization) allow suggestions that match public code.

In Visual Studio Code, You can find code references in the GitHub Copilot logs:
1. Open the Output window (`View` > `Output`)
2. Select `GitHub Copilot Log (Code References)` from the dropdown.


## Change the AI model for suggestions

1. Open the Command Palette
2. Select the **GitHub Copilot: Change Completions Model** command.


## Provide Context

Copilot looks at the current and open files in your editor to analyze the context and create appropriate suggestions.

Having related files open in VS Code while using Copilot helps set this context and lets Copilot get a bigger picture of your project.
