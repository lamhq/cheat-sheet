# Prompt files

Prompt files are reusable prompts you define for common and repeatable development tasks in a Markdown file.

You can include task-specific context and guidelines about how the task should be performed.


## Use cases

Create reusable prompts for common coding tasks, such as scaffolding a new component, API route, or generating tests

Define prompts for performing code reviews, such as checking for code quality, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues

Create step-by-step guides for complex processes or project-specific patterns

Define prompts for generating implementation plans, architectural designs, or migration strategies
