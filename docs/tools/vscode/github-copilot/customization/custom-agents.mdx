# Custom Agents

## Introduction

Custom Agents are specialized versions of the Copilot Coding Agent that you can tailor to specific roles or tasks (database administrator, front-end development, or planning)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available with the **GitHub Copilot Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro+, GitHub Copilot Business**, and **GitHub Copilot Enterprise** plans.


## Use Cases

Create a custom agent for planning, where the AI has read-only access to the codebase and can only generate implementation plans

Define a research custom agent, where the AI can reach out to external resources to explore new technologies or gather information

Create a front-end developer custom agent, where the AI can only generate and modify code related to front-end development


## Agent Profile

Custom agents are defined by Agent Profiles, which are Markdown files containing YAML frontmatter.

Agent profiles can be defined at two levels:
1. **Repository Level:** Defined in the `.github/agents/` directory for project-specific use.
2. **Organization/Enterprise Level:** Defined in the `/agents/` directory of a `.github-private` repository for broader availability.

An Agent Profile has two **components**:
- **YAML Frontmatter:** Defines the agent's metadata and capabilities.
   - Includes properties like `name`, a required `description`, and a list of available `tools` (e.g., `["read", "edit"]`).
   - Can configure access to external tools via the `mcp-servers` property (for Enterprise use).
- **Markdown Content:** containing custom instructions that dictate the agent's role and expertise.

Example:

```markdown
---
name: readme-creator
description: Agent specializing in creating and improving README files
---
You are a documentation specialist focused on README files. Your scope is limited to README files or other related documentation files only - do not modify or analyze code files.
```


## Usage

Once created, Custom Agents are available wherever the Copilot Coding Agent can be used, including:

- GitHub.com: Agents tab, Issue assignment, PRs.
- GitHub Copilot CLI.
- Visual Studio Code and other supported IDEs.
