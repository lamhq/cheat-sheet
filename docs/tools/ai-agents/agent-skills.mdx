# Agent Skills

## Introduction

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to  to do things more accurately and efficiently.

Skills gives agents access to company/team/user-specific context they can load on demand, extend their capabilities.


## How skills work

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.
2. **Activation**: The metadata helps agents decide which skills are relevant to a task. When a task matches a skill’s description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.
3. **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.


## Skill Folder Structure

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. 

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

Optional directories:
- `scripts/`: Contains executable code that agents can run. Scripts should:
  - Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
  - Include helpful error messages
  - Handle edge cases gracefully
- `references/`: Contains additional documentation that agents can read when needed:
  - `REFERENCE.md` - Detailed technical reference
  - `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
- `assets/`: Contains static resources that agents can use:
  - Templates (document templates, configuration templates)
  - Images (diagrams, examples)
  - Data files (lookup tables, schemas)

## `SKILL.md` Structure

Header:
- `name`: A unique identifier for the skill. Must be lowercase, using hyphens for spaces (for example, `webapp-testing`). Maximum 64 characters.
- `description`: A description of what the skill does and when to use it. Be specific about both capabilities and use cases to help Copilot decide when to load the skill. Maximum 1024 characters.

The **Body** contains the instructions, guidelines, and examples that Copilot should follow when using this skill:
- What the skill helps accomplish
- When to use the skill
- Step-by-step procedures to follow
- Examples of the expected input and output
- References to any included scripts or resources


## Examples

### Coding Best Practices

Help writing React/Next.js code that follows best practices.

This example illustrates how to instruct the agent to:
- Know when to use the skill
- Automatically read additional files when applied

Below is a briefed version of [Vercel React Best Practices](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md) skill:

This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns.

# React/Next.js Coding Best Practices

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new React components or Next.js pages
- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React/Next.js code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Eliminating Waterfalls | CRITICAL | `async-` |
| 2 | Bundle Size Optimization | CRITICAL | `bundle-` |
| 3 | Server-Side Performance | HIGH | `server-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)

- `async-defer-await` - Move await into branches where actually used
- `async-parallel` - Use Promise.all() for independent operations
- `async-dependencies` - Use better-all for partial dependencies
- `async-api-routes` - Start promises early, await late in API routes
- `async-suspense-boundaries` - Use Suspense to stream content

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)

- `bundle-barrel-imports` - Import directly, avoid barrel files
- `bundle-dynamic-imports` - Use next/dynamic for heavy components
- `bundle-defer-third-party` - Load analytics/logging after hydration
- `bundle-conditional` - Load modules only when feature is activated
- `bundle-preload` - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed

### 3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)

- `server-cache-react` - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication
- `server-cache-lru` - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching
- `server-serialization` - Minimize data passed to client components
- `server-parallel-fetching` - Restructure components to parallelize fetches
- `server-after-nonblocking` - Use after() for non-blocking operations

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/async-parallel.md
rules/bundle-barrel-imports.md
rules/_sections.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references

### Review Web UI

Review UI code for compliance with web interface best practices.

This example illustrates how to instruct the agent to:
- Know when to use the skill
- Follow a step-by-step process when executing the skill
- Use WebFetch to get external content
- Ask user to provide input if not given

Below is a briefed version of [Web Interface Guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md) skill:

````markdown title="my-skill/SKILL.md"
---
name: web-design-guidelines
description: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to "review my UI", "check accessibility", "audit design", "review UX", or "check my site against best practices".
metadata:
  author: vercel
  version: "1.0.0"
  argument-hint: <file-or-pattern>

# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

Use WebFetch to retrieve the latest rules. The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
