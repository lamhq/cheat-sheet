# Best practices

## Choose the right tool

Choose the right Copilot tool for the task.

### Inline suggestions

Inline suggestions works best for:

- Completing code snippets, variable names, and functions as you write them
- Generating code from inline comments in natural language


### Chat

Chat is best suited for:

- Answering questions about code, optionally calling on domain-specific chat participants.
- Have an ongoing chat conversation for brainstorming design ideas

For example, you can tell Copilot Chat that it is a Senior C++ Developer who cares greatly about code quality, readability, and efficiency, then ask it to review your code.


### Agent

Implement high-level requirements

Plan and implement the code changes across files and tools.


## Create good prompts

See [Prompt Engineering](../prompt.mdx#prompt-engineering).


## Choose the right AI model

For more details, see [AI model comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison).

### General-purpose coding

- **GPT-5-Codex**: higher-quality code on complex engineering tasks like features, tests, debugging, refactors, and reviews without lengthy instructions.
- **GPT-5 mini**: fast, accurate, and works well across languages and frameworks.
- **Grok Code Fast 1**: Performs well on code generation, and debugging across multiple languages.
- **Raptor mini**: fast, accurate inline suggestions and explanations.

When to use:
- Write or review functions, short files, or code diffs.
- Generate documentation, comments, or summaries.
- Explain errors or unexpected behavior quickly.
- Work in a non-English programming environment.


### Simple or repetitive tasks

- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: Balances fast responses with quality output. Ideal for small tasks and lightweight code explanations.

When to use:
- Write or edit small functions or utility code.
- Ask quick syntax or language questions.
- Prototype ideas with minimal setup.
- Get fast feedback on simple prompts or edits.


### Deep reasoning and debugging

- **GPT-5 mini**: Delivers deep reasoning and debugging with faster responses and lower resource usage than GPT-5. Ideal for interactive sessions and step-by-step code analysis.
- **GPT-5**: Great at complex reasoning, code analysis, and technical decision-making.
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Improves on 3.7 with more reliable completions and smarter reasoning under pressure.
- **Claude Opus 4.1**: Anthropic’s most powerful model. Improves on Claude Opus 4.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Advanced reasoning across long contexts and scientific or technical analysis.

When to use:
- Debug complex issues with context across **multiple files**.
- Refactor large or **interconnected codebases**.
- Plan features or architecture across layers.
- Weigh trade-offs between libraries, patterns, or workflows.
- Analyze logs, performance data, or system behavior.


### Working with visuals (diagrams, screenshots)

- **GPT-5 mini**: Reliable default for most coding and writing tasks. Fast, accurate, and supports multimodal input for visual reasoning tasks. Works well across languages and frameworks.
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Improves on 3.7 with more reliable completions and smarter reasoning under pressure.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Deep reasoning and debugging, ideal for complex code generation, debugging, and research workflows.

When to use:
- Ask questions about diagrams, screenshots, or UI components.
- Get feedback on visual drafts or workflows.
- Understand front-end behavior from visual context.


## Customize the AI

Customize the AI to your coding style and project conventions by using:
- Custom instructions
- [Custom agents](./coding-agent.mdx#custom-agents)
- Prompt files


## Extend the AI's capabilities

Extend the AI's capabilities with tools from [MCP](../mcp.mdx) servers or Marketplace extensions.


## Review Copilot's work

Fully understand Copilot's suggested code. Consider:
- Functionality
- Security
- Readability
- Maintainability

You can ask Copilot Chat to explain the code.


## Provide helpful context

- In IDE: open relevant files and close irrelevant files.
- In Copilot Chat: delete irrelevant requests from the conversation or start a new conversation.
- In Copilot Chat in your IDE: use keywords to focus Copilot on a specific task or piece of context.
- In Copilot Chat in GitHub: provide specific repositories, files, symbols, and more as context.


## Provide feedback

Provide feedback to improve future suggestions:

- For code completion, accept or reject Copilot's suggestion.
- For individual responses in Copilot Chat, click the thumbs up or thumbs down icons next to the response.
- For Copilot Chat in GitHub, leave a comment on the feedback discussion.
