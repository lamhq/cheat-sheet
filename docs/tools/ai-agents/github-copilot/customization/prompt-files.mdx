# Prompt files

## Introduction

Prompt files are reusable prompts (in Markdown files) you define for common and repeatable development tasks.

They can be run directly in chat and include task-specific guidelines or reference custom instructions to ensure consistent execution.

Two types of prompt files (base on scopes):

- **Workspace prompt files**: available within the workspace, stored in the `.github/prompts` folder.
- **User prompt files**: available across multiple workspaces, stored in the current [VS Code profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles).


## Use cases

You can define prompts for:
- **Common coding tasks**: scaffolding a new component, API route, or generating tests
- **Code reviews**: checking for code quality, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues
- **Step-by-step guides** for complex processes or project-specific patterns
- **Generating documentation**: implementation plans, architectural designs, or migration strategies

## Prompt File Structure

Prompt files are Markdown files and use the `.prompt.md` extension and have this structure:

### Header Optional

The header is formatted as YAML frontmatter with the following fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **description** | Short summary of what the prompt does |
| **name** | Command name used after typing `/` in chat |
| **argument-hint** | Hint text shown in chat input |
| **agent** | Which Copilot agent to use (`ask`, `edit`, `agent`, or custom agent) |
| **model** | Which LLM model to run with |
| **tools** | List of tools available to this prompt |

```yaml
---
name: my-prompt
description: "Does something useful"
agent: ask
model: GPT-4
tools:
  - githubRepo
---
```

### Body

Contains the prompt text that is sent to the LLM.

Provide specific instructions, guidelines, or any other relevant information that you want the AI to follow.

You can reference:
- Other workspace files by using Markdown links
- Agent tools using `#tool:<name>`  
- Variables like:
  - `${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolderBasename}`
  - `${selection}`, `${selectedText}`
  - `${file}`, `${fileBasename}`, `${fileDirname}`, `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`
  - `${input:variableName}`, `${input:variableName:placeholder}` (pass values to the prompt from the chat input field)


## Using prompt files

You have multiple options to run a prompt file:

1. In the **Chat view**, type `/` followed by the prompt name in the chat input field.

   You can add extra information in the chat input field. For example, `/create-react-form formName=MyForm` or `/create-api for listing customers`.

2. Run the `Chat: Run Prompt` command from the **Command Palette** and select a prompt file from the **Quick Pick**.

3. Open the prompt file in the editor, and press the play button in the title area. You can choose to run the prompt in the current chat session or open a new chat session.


## Prompt files Tips

- Clearly describe what the prompt should accomplish and what output format is expected.
- Provide examples of the expected input and output to guide the AI's responses.
- Use Markdown links to reference custom instructions rather than duplicating guidelines in each prompt.
- Take advantage of built-in variables like `${selection}` and input variables to make prompts more flexible.
- Use the editor play button to test your prompts and refine them based on the results.


## Examples

### Generate a React form component

```md
---
agent: 'agent'
model: GPT-4o
tools: ['githubRepo', 'search/codebase']
description: 'Generate a new React form component'
---
Your goal is to generate a new React form component based on the templates in #tool:githubRepo contoso/react-templates.

Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

Requirements for the form:
* Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](./prompt-files.mdx)
* Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
* Always define TypeScript types for your form data
* Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
* Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
* Use `yup` for validation:
* Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
* Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
* Customize UX-friendly validation rules
```


### Security review for a REST API

```md
---
agent: 'ask'
model: Claude Sonnet 4
description: 'Perform a REST API security review'
---
Perform a REST API security review and provide a TODO list of security issues to address.

* Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
* Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
* Implement rate limiting and throttling
* Implement logging and monitoring for security events

Return the TODO list in a Markdown format, grouped by priority and issue type.
```


## Sync prompt files

VS Code can sync your user prompt files across multiple devices by using [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files#_sync-user-prompt-files-across-devices).
