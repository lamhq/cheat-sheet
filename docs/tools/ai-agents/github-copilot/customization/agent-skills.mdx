# Agent Skills

Use Agent Skills in VS Code.

To use Agent Skills, enable the `chat.useAgentSkills` setting.


## Create a skill

To create a skill:

1. Create a `.github/skills` directory in your workspace.
2. Create a subdirectory for your skill (for example, `.github/skills/webapp-testing`).
3. Create a `SKILL.md` file in the skill directory with the following structure:

   ```md title=".github/skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md"
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Description of what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Instructions

   Your detailed instructions, guidelines, and examples go here...
   ```

4. (Optional) add scripts, examples, or other resources that the skill may need.

For example, a skill for testing web applications might include:

- `SKILL.md` - Instructions for running tests
- `test-template.js` - A template test file
- `examples/` - Example test scenarios


## Use shared skills

You can use skills created by others in [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) repository and [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repository.

To use a shared skill:

1. Browse the available skills in the repository
2. Copy the skill directory to your `.github/skills/` folder
3. Review and customize the `SKILL.md` file for your needs
4. Optionally, modify or add resources as needed


## Skill Examples

### Web application testing

````md title=".github/skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md"
---
name: webapp-testing
description: Guide for testing web applications using Playwright. Use this when asked to create or run browser-based tests.

# Web Application Testing with Playwright

This skill helps you create and run browser-based tests for web applications using Playwright.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create new Playwright tests for web applications
- Debug failing browser tests
- Set up test infrastructure for a new project

## Creating tests

1. Review the [test template](!./test-template.js) for the standard test structure
2. Identify the user flow to test
3. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory
4. Use Playwright's locators to find elements (prefer role-based selectors)
5. Add assertions to verify expected behavior

## Running tests

To run tests locally:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

To debug tests:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Best practices

- Use data-testid attributes for dynamic content
- Keep tests independent and atomic
- Use Page Object Model for complex pages
- Take screenshots on failure
