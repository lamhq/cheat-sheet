# Context preparation

To make AI agents generate accurate code, you need to prepare the following documents as context for the AI agents:

## 1. Project Overview
- An overview of the project, including its goals, scope, and timeline  
- A detailed description of the application's purpose, target audience, and key features  

```md
# Project Overview

## 1. Purpose  
*(Briefly explain why the application exists and what problem it solves.)*

## 2. Goals  
- *(List the main objectives of the project, e.g., improve customer experience, streamline workflows.)*  
- *(Include any secondary goals if relevant.)*

## 3. Scope & Timeline  
- **Scope**: *(What’s included in this project, what’s not.)*  
- **Timeline**: *(Key phases or milestones, e.g., launch date, major deliverables.)*

## 4. Target Audience  
- *(Describe who will use the application — roles, demographics, or customer segments.)*  
- *(Include main use cases or scenarios.)*

## 5. Key Features  
- *(List the most important features with short descriptions.)*  
- *(Highlight must-have vs. nice-to-have features.)*

## 6. Business Rules & Constraints  
- *(Document any rules the system must follow, e.g., “Users must be 18+ to register.”)*  
- *(Include compliance or policy constraints, e.g., GDPR, company policies.)*
```

## 2. System Architecture & Design
- Information about the technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the project  
- Codebase architecture including modules, components, and their interactions  
- Design patterns / coding recipes with example code snippets  
- Technical documents such as API documentation, database schema, and deployment processes  

```md
# System Architecture & Design

## 1. Overview  
*(Provide a high-level description of the system’s structure and purpose. Include a diagram if possible.)*  

- **System type**: *(e.g., web application, mobile app, microservices platform)*  
- **Key components**: *(List the major subsystems or services.)*  
- **Interaction summary**: *(How components communicate, e.g., REST APIs, message queues.)*  

## 2. Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: *(e.g., Python, JavaScript, Go)*  
- **Frameworks**: *(e.g., React, Django, Spring Boot)*  
- **Libraries**: *(e.g., Redux, NumPy, Lodash)*  
- **Tools**: *(e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions)*  
- **Databases**: *(e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)*  
- **Cloud/Infrastructure**: *(e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)*  

## 3. Architecture Documentation  
- **System Diagram**: *(Include or reference diagrams showing components and their relationships.)*  
- **Modules & Components**:  
  - *(List each module, its responsibilities, and dependencies.)*  
- **Data Flow**:  
  - *(Describe how data moves through the system — from input to storage to output.)*  
- **Integration Points**:  
  - *(External APIs, services, or third-party tools the system interacts with.)*  

## 4. Codebase Architecture  
- **Directory Structure**: *(Explain how the codebase is organized.)*  
- **Core Components**: *(Highlight key classes, services, or modules.)*  
- **Interactions**: *(Describe how components call or depend on each other.)*  

## 5. Design Patterns / Coding Recipes 
- **Patterns Used**: *(e.g., MVC, Repository, Singleton, Observer.)*  
- **Examples**: *(Provide short code snippets or pseudocode showing how patterns are applied.)*  
- **Rationale**: *(Why these patterns were chosen — scalability, maintainability, readability.)*  
```


## 3. Development Guidelines
- Coding standards / best practices to be followed  
- Version Control & Branching Strategy


## 4. Business Requirements
- Include functional requirements and user stories
- Any specific business rules or constraints that need to be followed
- Documents must be organized in separated domains / modules

```md
# 4. Business Requirements

## 4.1 Domain / Module: [Module Name]  
*(e.g., User Management, Payments, Reporting)*  

### Functional Requirements  
- **FR-1**: *(Describe the function clearly, e.g., “System must allow users to register with email and password.”)*  
- **FR-2**: *(“System must validate email format before submission.”)*  

### User Stories  
- **US-1**: *As a [user role], I want [feature] so that [benefit].*  
- **US-2**: *As an [admin], I want to [action] so that [outcome].*  

### Business Rules & Constraints  
- **Rule-1**: *(e.g., “A user must be at least 18 years old to register.”)*  
- **Rule-2**: *(e.g., “Payment transactions must be processed within 30 seconds.”)*  
- **Constraint-1**: *(e.g., “System must comply with GDPR data retention policies.”)*  

## 4.2 Domain / Module: [Module Name]  
*(Repeat the same structure for each domain/module.)*  

### Functional Requirements  
- **FR-1**: …  
- **FR-2**: …  

### User Stories  
- **US-1**: …  
- **US-2**: …  

### Business Rules & Constraints  
- **Rule-1**: …  
- **Constraint-1**: …  

## 4.n Additional Modules  
*(Add more domains/modules as needed, following the same format.)*
