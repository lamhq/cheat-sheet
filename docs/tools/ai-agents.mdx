# AI Agents

## Introduction

**AI agents** are autonomous programs designed to assist developers by handling tasks that traditionally require manual effort.

Think of them as **digital teammates**, not just tools, but active participants in the software development process.  


## Key Roles

- **Code Generation & Completion**: AI agents can write boilerplate code, suggest improvements, and auto-complete functions.
- **Debugging & Testing**: They detect errors, propose fixes, and even generate unit tests to improve reliability.
- **Planning & Project Management**: Agents can track issues, manage tickets, and prioritize tasks based on project goals.
- **DevOps Automation**: They handle deployment pipelines, monitor system health, and trigger alerts or fixes automatically.
- **Collaboration Support**: AI agents integrate with platforms like GitHub or Jira to assist teams in communication and workflow management.
