# Conventional Commits

## Overview

Conventional Commits is a way to write consistent and clear commit messages in your projects. 


## Commit format

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
 
[optional body]
 
[optional footer]
```

- **Type**: Categorizes the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`).
  - `feat`: Introduces a new feature
  - `fix`: Fixes a bug
  - `docs`: Updates documentation
  - `test`: Adds or corrects tests
  - `perf`: Improves performance
  - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
  - `build`: Affects the build system or external dependencies
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
- **Scope**: Section of the codebase related to the changes (optional, e.g., auth, API).
- **Description**: A brief summary of the change.
- **Body**: Detailed explanation of what was changed and why (optional). Begin with one blank line after the description.
- **Footer**: Additional information, like pull-requests, reviewers, breaking changes (optional).


## Examples

- `feat!: a commit that cause breaking changes`
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
- `fix(api): resolve issue with pagination in user endpoint`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `chore(deps): update dependency jest to v26.6.3`
- `style(main): reformat code to meet style guidelines`
- `refactor(utils): improve performance of data processing`
- `test(unit): add tests for validation functions`
- `ci(workflow): add build and test workflow`
- `perf(rendering): optimize image rendering for faster load times`

Commit message with breaking changes:
```
feat(api): add new endpoint for user registration

BREAKING CHANGE:
- Removed the `username` field from the user object.
- Changed the `email` field to be required.

## Benefits

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.


## Semantic Versioning

How does this relate to SemVer?
- `fix` type commits should be translated to `PATCH` releases.
- `feat` type commits should be translated to `MINOR` releases.
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in the commits are translated to `MAJOR` releases.


## How to use conventional commit?

Your contributors/teammates aren't required to use the conventional commit specification. They only need to submit pull requests.

When merging a pull request, Git lead maintainers should choose to automatically squash commits enter the proper git commit message for the merge.
