# MSI Afterburner

How to display computer information (FPS, CPU, GPU usage, temperature, ...) while gaming using MSI Afterburner.


1. Download and Install Afterburner from the [official MSI website](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards), then extract and install the software, making sure to also install RivaTuner.
2. Open Afterburner Settings:
   - Enable "Start with Windows" and "Start minimized".
   - Navigate to the "Monitoring" tab, to show FPS, enable "Framerate" and click "Show in On-Screen Display"
   - For better display, check "Override group name" and assign a common name for related items, like "RTX 4060"
   - If you prefer a graph display over text, change the display format to "graph"
3. After making all desired changes, click "Apply"
