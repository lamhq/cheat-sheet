# Optimize Windows

## Turning off services

Optimize PC performance by disabling unnecessary Windows services.

**Open the Services app**:

1. Press **Windows + R** on your keyboard â€” this opens the Run box.
2. Type `services.msc` and hit **Enter**.

Stop & disable these services:
**Connected User Experiences and Telemetry**: This feature tracks user habits and personal information, sending it to Microsoft.
* **Optimize Drives**: This feature is designed for defragmenting older HDD drives.
* **Windows Insider Service**: This service consumes significant network resources by allowing users to experience early advertisements and beta updates for Windows.
