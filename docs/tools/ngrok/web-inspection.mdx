# Web Inspection Interface

## What It Is?

The **Web Inspection Interface** is a browser-based tool that runs locally at `http://localhost:4040`.

It provides a real-time view of HTTP requests and responses that pass through your ngrok tunnel.


## Key Features

- **Request Inspection**: View full details of incoming HTTP requests including headers, body, and metadata.
- **Response Inspection**: See the exact response your local server sent back.
- **Replay Requests**: Resend any captured request to your server with a single click—great for debugging webhooks.
- **History Navigation**: Browse through a timeline of past requests to analyze behavior over time.

## How to Use It
- Start your ngrok tunnel (e.g., `ngrok http 3000`).
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4040`.
- Use the interface to monitor and interact with traffic flowing through your tunnel.

## Use Cases
- **Webhook Debugging**: Easily inspect and replay webhook payloads from services like Stripe, GitHub, or Twilio.
- **API Testing**: Validate how your local API handles different requests.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Understand request patterns and troubleshoot issues without needing external logging tools.
