# MCP

Use MCP servers in VS Code.

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how various applications can share context with Large Language Models (LLMs).


## Benefits

- MCP extends AI assistant's capabilities, enabling it to interact with external systems like knowledge bases, data stores, and testing applications.
- MCP integration allows performing tasks that previously required multiple tools, context switching, and manual effort — all directly in IDE.
- MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations between each AI model and each tool.


## How MCP works?

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

- MCP clients (like VS Code) connect to MCP servers and request actions on behalf of the AI model
- MCP servers provide one or more tools that expose specific functionalities through a well-defined interface
- Model Context Protocol defines the message format for communication between clients and servers, including tool discovery, invocation, and response handling

For example:
- a file system MCP server might provide tools for reading, writing, or searching files and directories
- GitHub's MCP server offers tools to list repositories, create pull requests, or manage issues.

MCP servers can run locally on your machine or be hosted remotely.

MCP servers can run arbitrary code on your machine. Only add servers from trusted sources.


## MCP Use Cases

### Bridge Design and Development with Figma

Copilot can securely access and interpret design specifications directly from Figma.

It automatically retrieves exact design parameters (colors, spacing, etc.) to generate accurate, ready-to-use code (React components), reducing manual translation.

### Tap into Your Knowledge Base with Obsidian

The Obsidian MCP server connects Copilot to your Obsidian vault (Markdown notes).

This allows Copilot to search past decisions, architectural notes, and research findings, and even create new summary documentation directly in your vault.

### Test Your Code with Playwright

Integrating with the Playwright MCP server transforms test creation into a guided experience.

Copilot can analyze your implementation, generate comprehensive tests (e.g., for complex authentication flows), run them, and provide immediate feedback with suggested fixes.

### File Pull Requests Faster

The GitHub remote MCP server helps automate the creation of pull requests (PRs).

Copilot analyzes code changes, related issues, and context to generate a detailed PR summary (overview, changes, testing strategy) and suggest appropriate reviewers.

### Monitor Application Performance with Grafana

Connecting to the Grafana MCP server allows for easier application performance monitoring.

Copilot can query your Grafana instance to examine metrics like latency and error rates, returning panel data or raw time-series information for analysis.


## Add an MCP server

Common ways to add an MCP server to VS Code:

1. [From GitHub MCP server registry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-from-the-github-mcp-server-registry)
2. Using workspace `mcp.json` file
3. Add an MCP server to a dev container

After installed, you can perform various [actions on the installed MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers#_manage-installed-mcp-servers):
- Start or stop a server
- View the server logs
- Uninstall the server
- ...


## Use MCP tools

Once you have added an MCP server, you can use the tools it provides in chat.

Tools can be **automatically invoked** when using agents or **explicitly referenced** in your prompts (typing `#` followed by the tool name).

You'll be prompted to review and approve tool invocations.

### Control used MCP tools

You can use the tool picker button in the Chat view to select which tools the agent can use (MCP tools are grouped by server)

You can create custom prompts or agents that specify which MCP tools to use.


## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can give direct access to resources that you can use as context in your chat prompts.

1. In the Chat view, select **Add Context** > **MCP Resources**
2. Select a resource type from the list and provide optional resource input parameters.

To view the list of available resources, use `MCP: Browse Resources` command

To view resources for a specific server, use `MCP: List Servers` > `Browse Resources` command


## Use MCP prompts

MCP servers can provide preconfigured prompts for common tasks.

To invoke an MCP prompt in chat, type `/` in the chat input field, followed by the prompt name, formatted as `mcp.servername.promptname`.
