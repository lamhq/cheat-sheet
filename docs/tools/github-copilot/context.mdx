# Providing Context

Improve your Copilot Chat results by using Copilot Spaces to  organize and share context with Copilot.

## Copilot Spaces

Copilot Spaces let you organize the context that Copilot uses to answer your questions.

Spaces can include repositories, code, pull requests, issues, free-text content like transcripts or notes, images, and file uploads.

You can ask Copilot questions grounded in that context, or share the space with your team to support collaboration and knowledge sharing.


## Where can I use Spaces?

You can ask Copilot questions in the space's chat interface in GitHub. Your chat will be grounded in the context you've added.

You can also [access space context from your IDE](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces/use-copilot-spaces#accessing-space-context-from-your-ide), using the GitHub MCP server.


## Usage & Quotas

Questions you submit in a space count as Copilot Chat requests.

- If you're a Copilot Free user, this usage counts toward your monthly chat limit.
- If you use Spaces with a premium model, this usage counts toward your premium usage quota.


## Creating a Space

Go to https://github.com/copilot/spaces to create a new space.


## Adding context to a space

You can add two types of context to your space:

### Instructions

- These are pieces of **free text** that define Copilot's **role** and **areas of expertise** within this specific space.
- Instructions guide Copilot on what to focus on, what tasks it should help with, and what it should avoid.
- Example: Telling Copilot, "You are a SQL generator. Your job is to generate SQL queries based on the user's goals and the attached data schemas."

### Sources

These are the files, documents, and links that provide the data for Copilot to ground its responses in.

GitHub files and other GitHub-based sources added to a space are automatically updated as they change.

You can add sources by:

- **Adding Files and Repositories:** You can link **entire GitHub repositories**, specific **files**, or **folders**.
- **Linking GitHub Content:** You can paste the **URLs** of specific **pull requests** or **issues**.
- **Uploading a File:** You can upload various documents directly from your machine, including **images, text files, rich documents, and spreadsheets.**
- **Adding Text Content:** You can type or paste **free-text content** like notes, meeting transcripts, or any other relevant non-file information.
