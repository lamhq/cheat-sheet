# Best practices

## Choose the right Copilot tool for the job

Use Copilot for coding and technology.

### Code completion

Code completion works best for:

- Completing code snippets, variable names, and functions as you write them
- Generating repetitive code
- Generating code from inline comments in natural language
- Generating tests for test-driven development


### Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat is best suited for:

- Answering questions about code
- Generating large sections of code
- Accomplishing specific tasks with keywords and skills. Copilot Chat has built-in keywords and skills designed to provide important context for prompts and accomplish common tasks quickly. Different types of keywords and skills are available in different Copilot Chat platforms. See Asking GitHub Copilot questions in your IDE.
- Completing a task as a specific persona. For example, you can tell Copilot Chat that it is a Senior C++ Developer who cares greatly about code quality, readability, and efficiency, then ask it to review your code.


## Create good prompts

Structuring your request so Copilot can easily understand and respond to it (Prompt engineering) by:
- Break down complex tasks.
- Be specific about your requirements.
- Provide examples of things like input data, outputs, and implementations.
- Follow good coding practices.


## Review Copilot's work

Fully understand Copilot's suggested code. Consider:
- Functionality
- Security
- Readability
- Maintainability

You can ask Copilot Chat to explain the code.


## Provide helpful context

- In IDE: open relevant files and close irrelevant files.
- In Copilot Chat: delete irrelevant requests from the conversation or start a new conversation.
- In Copilot Chat in your IDE: use keywords to focus Copilot on a specific task or piece of context.
- In Copilot Chat in GitHub: provide specific repositories, files, symbols, and more as context.
