# Prompt Examples

Examples of prompts to use with GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Creating templates

Create a template for a project README file:

```text
Create a README template for a new open-source project that includes sections for project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. Make it clear and easy to follow.
```

## Summarize

```text
Can you summarize the key points and action items from this discussion?
```


## Creating diagrams

```text
Create a mermaid gantt diagram that covers the period August 1st 2025 until January 31st, 2025. Include 5 phases, each taking 6 weeks, and overlapping equally.
```

## Find implementation approachs

You want to evaluate different approaches to implement a feature to see whether they fit with your needs and constraints.

```text
Given the feature specification below, list options for implementation and tradeoffs for each option.

## Feature Description
Users have requested a "Recent Items" section on their dashboard to quickly access the most recently viewed documents, projects, or files. This section should display the ten most recent items, sorted by the last access time.

## Requirements
* Display up to ten items that the user has accessed recently.
* Items must be sorted by the time they were last accessed.
* The solution should minimize database load.
* Data should reflect updates in near real-time.
* The solution should prioritize performance, especially for large datasets of items.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Dashboard loads the "Recent Items" section within 200ms under normal load.
* The solution must not degrade performance for users with thousands of items.
```
