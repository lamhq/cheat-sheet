# Pull Requests

This feature is only available in GitHub Copilot Coding Agent.

## Creating a pull request

You can ask Copilot to create a pull request from many places:

- **Copilot Chat (IDEs and GitHub.com):**
    * In **Visual Studio Code** by clicking "Delegate to Agent" button or by using the `@github` mention.
    * On **GitHub.com**, by using the `/task` command in Copilot Chat.
- **GitHub Issues:** By simply assigning an Issue to Copilot (`@copilot`) on GitHub.com or GitHub Mobile.
- **GitHub UI (Agents Tab/Dashboard):** By using the **Agents tab** or the **Task button** on your personal GitHub dashboard and providing a prompt.
- **GitHub CLI:** By running the command **`gh agent-task create "Your descriptive prompt"`**.
- **GitHub Mobile:** By tapping the Copilot icon in a repository and entering a prompt.
- **New Repository Page:** When creating a new repository, you can enter a prompt to ask Copilot to **seed the new repository** with initial code.

**How it work**:

1. You provide a prompt describing the request (e.g., "Implement a user friendly message for common errors"). You can optionally specify a target repository, a base branch, and even a **Custom Agent** to use for the work.
2. The agent pushes the changes to a new branch and opens a draft Pull Request.
3. Copilot then adds you as a reviewer to the PR, triggering a notification for you to review the completed work.
4. To ask Copilot to fix its work, you must submit a formal review with the status set to **Request changes**.


## Update existing pull requests

1. You ask Copilot to make changes to an existing pull request by leaving a **comment or review** on the PR and mention Copilot **`@copilot`**, provide instructions for the changes
2. Copilot creates a **new, child pull request**. This child PR uses the original PR's branch as its base branch.
3. Copilot performs the requested changes in this new branch. Once the agent finishes the work, it requests your review on the child pull request.
4. If you are satisfied, you merge the child PR into the original PR's branch.
