# Prompt engineering

Prompt engineering for GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Introduction

A prompt is any request you make to Copilot (a question, a code completion request, etc.).

Copilot uses the prompt, along with context (like the code in your current file and the chat history), to generate a response.

Follow these strategies to improve your Copilot results.

## Start General, Then Get Specific

Begin your prompt by giving Copilot a broad description of the goal or scenario, and then follow up by listing any specific requirements.

For example:

```
Write a JavaScript function that tells me if a number is prime

The function should take an integer and return true if the integer is prime

The function should error if the input is not a positive integer
```

## Give Examples

Use examples of input data, expected outputs, or implementation styles to help Copilot understand exactly what you want. Unit tests can also serve as examples.

```
Write a Go function that finds all dates in a string and returns them in an array. Dates can be formatted like:

* 05/02/24
* 05/02/2024
* 5/2/24
* 5/2/2024
* 05-02-24
* 05-02-2024
* 5-2-24
* 5-2-2024

Example:

findDates("I have a dentist appointment on 11/14/2023 and book club on 12-1-23")

Returns: ["11/14/2023", "12-1-23"]
```

## Break Complex Tasks into Simpler Tasks

If you have a large or complicated task, divide it into multiple small, simple tasks and ask Copilot to complete them one by one.

For example, instead of asking Copilot to generate a word search puzzle, break the process down into smaller tasks, and ask Copilot to accomplish them one by one:

- Write a function to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters.
- Write a function to find all words in a grid of letters, given a list of valid words.
- Write a function that uses the previous functions to generate a 10 by 10 grid of letters that contains at least 10 words.
- Update the previous function to print the grid of letters and 10 random words from the grid.


## Avoid Ambiguity

Be specific in your prompts.

For instance, instead of asking "what does this do," specify "What does the `createUser` function do?" If using an uncommon library, describe what it does.


## Indicate Relevant Code

### For code suggestions in the IDE

Open any relevant files and close irrelevant ones, as Copilot uses open files for context.

### For Copilot Chat

Highlight the specific code you want Copilot to reference, or use keywords (like `@workspace` in VS Code or `@project` in JetBrains IDEs) to manually supply context.


## Experiment and Iterate

If the initial result is not what you wanted, refine your prompt and try again.

For chat, you can reference the previous response in your next request or simply delete the previous response and start over.


## Keep History Relevant

In Copilot Chat:
- Use threads to start a new conversation for a new task
- Delete requests that are no longer relevant or that didn’t give you the desired result


## Follow Good Coding Practices

Ensure the existing code in your codebase follows best practices:

- Use a consistent code style and patterns
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Comment your code
- Structure your code into modular, scoped components
- Include unit tests
