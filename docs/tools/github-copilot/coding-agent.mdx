# Coding Agent

## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot coding agent is available with the GitHub Copilot Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro+, GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise plans.

Copilot coding agent can:
- Fix bugs
- Implement new features
- Improve test coverage
- Update documentation
- Address technical debt

You delegate tasks to Copilot coding agent by:
- Assigning an Issue to Copilot.
- Mentioning `@copilot` in an existing PR comment.
- Asking via Copilot Chat or the Agents Panel.


## Copilot coding agent vs Agent mode

Copilot coding agent is distinct from the "agent mode" feature available in IDE. 

Copilot coding agent works autonomously in a GitHub Actions-powered environment to complete development tasks assigned through GitHub issues or GitHub Copilot Chat prompts, and creates pull requests with the results. 

Agent mode in IDE makes autonomous edits directly in your local development environment. 


## Usage Costs

Copilot coding agent uses GitHub Actions minutes and Copilot premium requests.

Within your monthly usage allowance for GitHub Actions and premium requests, you can ask Copilot coding agent to work on coding tasks without incurring any additional costs.


## Limitations

The agent has several workflow and compatibility limitations:

* Can only make changes in the **same repository** as the assigned task.
* Cannot make changes **across multiple repositories** in one run.
* Can only open **one PR per task**.
* By default, only accesses context in the **assigned repository**.
* Does not work in personal repositories owned by **managed user accounts**.
* Does **not account for content exclusions** (it can see and update excluded files).
* The AI model used (currently **Claude Sonnet 4.5**) cannot be selected by the user.


## Custom Agents

### Introduction

Custom Agents are specialized versions of the Copilot Coding Agent that you can tailor to specific workflows / tasks.

Examples of custom agents you could create:
- **Testing Specialist:** Agent focused on test coverage and quality, configured with specific testing frameworks. Limited to read/search/edit tools to protect production code.
- **Documentation Expert:** Agent specialized in creating/maintaining documentation, using knowledge of standards and style guides to generate accurate API docs and user guides from code analysis.
- **Python Specialist:** Language-specific agent that understands Python conventions, popular frameworks (Django/Flask), and follows PEP standards, with knowledge of Python tooling and testing (pytest).

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available with the **GitHub Copilot Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro+, GitHub Copilot Business**, and **GitHub Copilot Enterprise** plans.


### Agent Profile

Custom agents are defined by Agent Profiles, which are Markdown files containing YAML frontmatter.

Agent profiles can be defined at two levels:
1. **Repository Level:** Defined in the `.github/agents/` directory for project-specific use.
2. **Organization/Enterprise Level:** Defined in the `/agents/` directory of a `.github-private` repository for broader availability.

An Agent Profile has two **components**:
- **YAML Frontmatter:** Defines the agent's metadata and capabilities.
   - Includes properties like `name`, a required `description`, and a list of available `tools` (e.g., `["read", "edit"]`).
   - Can configure access to external tools via the `mcp-servers` property (for Enterprise use).
- **Markdown Content:** containing custom instructions that dictate the agent's role and expertise.

Example:

```markdown
---
name: readme-creator
description: Agent specializing in creating and improving README files
---
You are a documentation specialist focused on README files. Your scope is limited to README files or other related documentation files only - do not modify or analyze code files.
```


### Usage

Once created, Custom Agents are available wherever the Copilot Coding Agent can be used, including:

- GitHub.com: Agents tab, Issue assignment, PRs.
- GitHub Copilot CLI.
- Visual Studio Code and other supported IDEs.
