# Customize Responses

Customizing the behavior of GitHub Copilot to fit with your preferences and requirements in Visual Studio Code.

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot can provide responses that are tailored to your team's workflow, tools, and the specifics of your project.

Instead of repeatedly including contextual details in your prompts, you create **files** in your repository that automatically give Copilot the necessary information.

In VS Code, there are two primary ways to provide this context via files:

- **Repository Custom Instructions:** Used to specify general instructions and preferences that Copilot should consider when working *anywhere* in the repository's context.
- **Prompt Files (Public Preview):** Used to save and reuse common, specific prompt instructions and relevant context in Markdown files (`*.prompt.md`), typically for a single, specific chat interaction.


## Repository Custom Instructions

VS Code supports three types of repository custom instructions:

- **Repository-Wide Custom Instructions:**
   - Apply to **all requests** made within the repository's context.
   - Specified in a single file: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

- **Path-Specific Custom Instructions:**
   - Apply only to requests made in the context of files that match a **specified file path**.
   - Specified in one or more `NAME.instructions.md` files placed in the directory: `.github/instructions/`.
   - Useful for avoiding information overload by providing context only relevant to specific types of files or directories

- **Agent Instructions:**
   - These are similar to repository-wide instructions but are currently used to configure specific Copilot agents.
   - Specified in files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`.

Instructions are sent with every chat message.


## Writing Effective Custom Instructions

Guidelines for good instructions:

- Short, self-contained statements that are broadly applicable to most requests.
- Provide an overview of the project you're working on, including its purpose, goals, and any relevant background information.
- Include the folder structure of the repository, including any important directories or files that are relevant to the project.
- Specify the coding standards and conventions that should be followed, such as naming conventions, formatting rules, and best practices.
- Include any specific tools, libraries, or frameworks that are used in the project, along with any relevant version numbers or configurations.

Example of repository-wide custom instructions:

```md title=".github/copilot-instructions.md"
# Project Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists. It is built using React and Node.js, and uses MongoDB for data storage.

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains the source code for the frontend.
- `/server`: Contains the source code for the Node.js backend.
- `/docs`: Contains documentation for the project, including API specifications and user guides.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
- Node.js and Express for the backend.
- MongoDB for data storage.

## Coding Standards

- Use semicolons at the end of each statement.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use function based components in React.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.

## UI guidelines

- A toggle is provided to switch between light and dark mode.
- Application should have a modern and clean design.
