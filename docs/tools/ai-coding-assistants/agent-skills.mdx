# Agent Skills

## Introduction

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to  to do things more accurately and efficiently.

Skills gives agents access to company/team/user-specific context they can load on demand, extend their capabilities.


## How skills work

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.
2. **Activation**: The metadata helps agents decide which skills are relevant to a task. When a task matches a skill’s description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.
3. **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.


## Skill Folder Structure

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. 

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

Optional directories:
- `scripts/`: Contains executable code that agents can run. Scripts should:
  - Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
  - Include helpful error messages
  - Handle edge cases gracefully
- `references/`: Contains additional documentation that agents can read when needed:
  - `REFERENCE.md` - Detailed technical reference
  - `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
- `assets/`: Contains static resources that agents can use:
  - Templates (document templates, configuration templates)
  - Images (diagrams, examples)
  - Data files (lookup tables, schemas)

## `SKILL.md` Structure

Header:
- `name`: A unique identifier for the skill. Must be lowercase, using hyphens for spaces (for example, `webapp-testing`). Maximum 64 characters.
- `description`: A description of what the skill does and when to use it. Be specific about both capabilities and use cases to help Copilot decide when to load the skill. Maximum 1024 characters.

The **Body** contains the instructions, guidelines, and examples that Copilot should follow when using this skill:
- What the skill helps accomplish
- When to use the skill
- Step-by-step procedures to follow
- Examples of the expected input and output
- References to any included scripts or resources
