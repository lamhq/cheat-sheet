# Notion MCP Server

## Overview

Notion MCP Server is an MCP server implementation for the Notion API that enables LLM-based agents to interact with Notion workspaces.

It provides tools tailored for AI agents to work with Notion pages, databases (data sources), blocks, and more, with optimized token consumption.

Notion also offers a [remote MCP server](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp) with improved features including easy OAuth installation.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js 18 or higher
2. A Notion account with workspace access
3. Create an integration in Notion and obtain an integration token


## Workflow

Adding Notion MCP Server involves the following steps:

1. [Create a Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and obtain the integration token
2. Configure integration access to your content (pages, databases)
3. Add MCP server configuration to your client


## Installation

### 1. Create an integration

Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new internal integration.

### 2. Configure integration access

Ensure relevant pages and databases are accessible by the integration.

Visit the Access tab in your internal integration settings. Edit access and select the pages you'd like to use.

### 3. Adding MCP config to your client

For VS Code, add the following to your `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
{
  "servers": {
    "notion": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_TOKEN": "${input:notion_token}"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "notion_token",
      "type": "promptString",
      "description": "Enter your Notion integration token",
      "password": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Start the MCP server by clicking `Start` in the actions inline in the editor, then enter your Notion integration token when prompted.
