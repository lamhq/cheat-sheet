# Smart Actions

How to use VS Code AI features for common development tasks (without writing prompts).

## Analysis

### Explain code

1. Select the code you want to explain.
2. Right-click and select **Explain**.


### Search Code

**Semantic search** enables you to find results that are **semantically relevant** to your search query, even if they don't match the text exactly.

You can choose to run semantic search automatically, or only when you explicitly request it by the config `search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior`.

Search view can also display **keyword suggestions** that provide relevant alternative search terms. Enable this feature using `search.searchView.keywordSuggestions` config.

You can reference search results in your chat prompt by typing `#searchResults` in the chat prompt.


## Coding

### Implement todo comments

1. Make sure you have the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension installed.
2. Add a `TODO` comment in your code. A code action (lightbulb) appears next to the comment.
3. Select the code action and select **Delegate to coding agent**.

## Markdown

### Generate alt text for images

## VS Code

### Find setting name

If you don't know the exact name of a VS Code setting, you can use AI to help find the relevant settings based on your search query.

For example, you can search for "increase text size" to find the setting that controls the editor font size.

Enable this functionality with the `workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle` setting.
