# Coding Agent

## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot coding agent is available with the GitHub Copilot Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro+, GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise plans.

Copilot coding agent can:
- Fix bugs
- Implement new features
- Improve test coverage
- Update documentation
- Address technical debt

You delegate tasks to Copilot coding agent by:
- Assigning an Issue to Copilot.
- Mentioning `@copilot` in an existing PR comment.
- Asking via Copilot Chat or the Agents Panel.


## Copilot coding agent vs Agent mode

Copilot coding agent is distinct from the "agent mode" feature available in IDE. 

Copilot coding agent works autonomously in a GitHub Actions-powered environment to complete development tasks assigned through GitHub issues or GitHub Copilot Chat prompts, and creates pull requests with the results. 

Agent mode in IDE makes autonomous edits directly in your local development environment. 


## Usage Costs

Copilot coding agent uses GitHub Actions minutes and Copilot premium requests.

Within your monthly usage allowance for GitHub Actions and premium requests, you can ask Copilot coding agent to work on coding tasks without incurring any additional costs.


## Limitations

The agent has several workflow and compatibility limitations:

* Can only make changes in the **same repository** as the assigned task.
* Cannot make changes **across multiple repositories** in one run.
* Can only open **one PR per task**.
* By default, only accesses context in the **assigned repository**.
* Does not work in personal repositories owned by **managed user accounts**.
* Does **not account for content exclusions** (it can see and update excluded files).
* The AI model used (currently **Claude Sonnet 4.5**) cannot be selected by the user.
