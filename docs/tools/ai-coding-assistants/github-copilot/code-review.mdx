# Code review

How to request a code review from GitHub Copilot.

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot can review code (in the IDE) and review pull requests.

It provides feedback that includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

It can review code written in any programming language.


## Availability

Available to users with Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plans.

Copilot code review is supported in:
- GitHub.com
- GitHub Mobile
- VS Code
- Visual Studio
- Xcode
- JetBrains IDEs


## Quota

Each time Copilot reviews a pull request, or reviews code in your IDE, your monthly quota of Copilot premium requests is reduced by one.

If a repository is configured to automatically request code review, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author.


## Adding Copilot as a reviewer

Copilot can review code changes in your IDE before opening a pull request, or be assigned as reviewer to a pull request.

### In IDE

**Reviewing a selection of code**:
1. In Visual Studio Code, select the code you want to review.
2. Right-click the selected code and choose **Generate Code** > **Review**.
3. VS Code creates review comments in the Comments panel and also shows them inline in the editor.

**Reviewing all uncommitted changes**:
1. In Visual Studio Code, click the Source Control button in the **Activity Bar**.
2. At the top of the **Source Control view**, hover over **CHANGES**, then click the **Copilot Code Review - Uncommitted Changes** button.

3. Wait for Copilot to review your changes. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.
4. If Copilot has any comments, they will be shown inline in your file(s), and in the Problems tab.


### Reviewing PRs

1. On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.
2. Open the **Reviewers** menu, then select **Copilot**.

3. Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.
4. Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.
5. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.
6. Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments won't be replied.


If you make changes to the pull request and you want Copilot to re-review the pull request, you can request this manually (click the button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu).


## Use Copilot as a review assistant

You can use Copilot to speed up your pull request review.

**Ask Copilot to summarize the changes made to a file**:

**Ask Copilot to explain highlighted lines of code**:

**Ask Copilot for its own opinion on the PR changes**:

```
Provide your judgement as a PR Reviewer, both for functional and non-functional aspects that these changes bring
```

**Ask Copilot for its own opinion on your PR comment**:

```
As my peer reviewer on this pull request, give me your feedback on my own review: YOUR-REVIEW-COMMENT. Do you think it's pertinent? Am I missing something?
```

**Refine your review comments**:

```
Make a list of review comments to add to the PR and tell me exactly in which file diff and lines each comment should be added
```

```
Refine this review comment to make it clear, concise, and actionable.
```


## Working with suggested changes

Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

You can also invoke Copilot coding agent to implement suggested changes by clicking **Implement suggestion** on review comments. Copilot will create a new pull request against your branch with the suggestions applied.


## Customizing Copilot's reviews

You can tailor the generated reviews to match your team's specific coding standards, tools, and practices, using:
- Repository Custom Instructions
- Organization Custom Instructions

This example of a repository instructions:

```markdown title=".github/copilot-instructions.md"
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, apply the checks in the `/security/security-checklist.md` file.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```


## Automatic pull request reviews

Individual users on the Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests they create.

Repository owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in the repository.

Organization owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in some or all of the repositories in the organization.

To configure Copilot to automatically review new pull requests, see [Configuring automatic code review by GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-code-review/configuring-automatic-code-review-by-copilot).


## Best Practices

Developers should **request a review in the IDE before opening a pull request**.

Administrators should set up repository (or organization rulesets) to **automatically add Copilot as a reviewer** on any pull request targeting protected branches.

Team leads should **capture team's standard style and rules as custom instructions** for the organization so that Copilot can leverage them in reviews.
