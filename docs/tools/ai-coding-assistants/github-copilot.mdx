# GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps you write code faster, allowing you to focus on problem solving and collaboration.

This guide is for individual users with GitHub Copilot Pro plan, using Visual Studio Code and GitHub web interface.


## Features

- **Planning**:
   - Copilot Chat can help you brainstorm and identify the best technologies for your project.
   - Copilot Chat can create issues to help track your ideas.
   - Copilot Spaces direct Copilot's responses in the right context for a specific task
- **Code creation**:
   - Copilot inline suggestions help add code as you type.
   - Next edit suggestions (public preview) predicts the next edit you are likely to make and suggests a completion for it.
   - Copilot Chat can answer questions and offer suggestions in a conversational environment.
   - Copilot coding agent can make code changes, create a pull request for you to review.
- **Reviews**:
   - Copilot code review gives you feedback in your favorite IDE, or as a pull request review on GitHub.
- **Testing**:
   - Copilot Chat can help you write and debug tests.
- **Deployment**:
   - Copilot Chat can help you configure continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Operation**:
   - You can assign Copilot coding agent to an open issue and it will automatically raise a pull request to address the necessary changes.
   - Copilot Chat can help with tasks you're working on yourself.
   - Copilot pull request summaries generate summaries of a pull request.


## Use Cases

1. **Planning**
    - Use **Copilot Chat** to get a development overview, create structured issues
    - Set up a **Copilot Space** with all the necessary project context (mockups, code links).
2. **Scaffolding**
    - Use **GitHub Spark** (a no-code environment) to generate working apps with integrated LLMs.
3. **Writting code**
    - Use **GitHub Models playground** to compare different AI models for effectiveness and cost.
    - Use **Copilot agent mode** in the IDE to perform complex, autonomous tasks like refactoring code across multiple files, guided by custom instructions and developer authorization.
4. **Testing**
    - Use **MCP Server** (e.g., for Playwright) to enable the Copilot agent to run automated in-browser tests.
    - The agent can then identify failing tests and suggest code fixes.
5. **Reviewing**
    - **Copilot code review** provides an initial automated review of the pull request (PR) to catch bugs early.
    - **Copilot custom agents** (configured with internal policies) can be prompted to review the PR for compliance before a human checks it.
6. **Optimizing**
    - For small, well-scoped maintenance tasks (e.g., switching an API), the product manager can assign an issue directly to the **Copilot coding agent** on GitHub.
    - The agent works asynchronously, opens a PR, and can incorporate feedback from human reviewers.
7. **Security**
    - When code scanning finds a vulnerability, **Copilot Autofix** can be requested to automatically suggest a fix, which a developer then reviews and approves.


## Availability

Copilot is available:

- On the **GitHub website** via Chat
- On the **command line**, through the GitHub CLI
- In your **IDE**
- In **GitHub Mobile**, as a chat interface
