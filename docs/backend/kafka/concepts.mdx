# Concepts

## Brokers

A broker is a server that manage data.

It receives data from producers, stores it, and serves it to consumers.

Data is replicated across multiple brokers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.


## Cluster

A cluster is a group of brokers working together to manage and distribute data.

One broker acts as the controller to handle administrative tasks, while others manage data storage and retrieval.

Clusters can be expanded without downtime.


## Topics

A topic is a stream of messages belonging to a particular category.

*For example, a topic could be used to store temperature readings from sensors.*


## Partitions

A topic are split into partitions, which are distributed across brokers.

Partition distribution:
- Each broker may host zero or more partitions for a given topic.
- If the number of partitions equals the number of brokers, each broker will typically host one partition.
- If the number of partitions is fewer than the number of brokers, some brokers won't have any partitions for that topic.

Partition replication:
- Each partition is replicated to other nodes.
- There's a leader node for handling requests and follower nodes for replication.
- A follower acts as normal consumer, pulls messages and up-dates its own data store.
- If the leader fails, one of the follower will automatically become the new leader.

More partitions can increase throughput but also may increase the latency of the queue.


## Producers

Producers are the publisher of messages to one or more Kafka topics.

Producers send data to Kafka brokers. Every time a producer publishes a message, the message will be appended to a partition.

Producer can send messages to a specific partition.


## Consumers

Consumers read data from brokers by subscribing to one or more Kafka topics and reads messages from partitions.


## Consumer Groups

A consumer group is a group of consumers that work together to consume a topic.

A consumer may belong to one consumer group.

*For example, in Microservices architecture, all instances of a service will be in the same consumer group.*


### Behavior

When multiple consumer groups subscribe to the same topic, each receives a copy of the message, enabling each group to process the message base on its own purpose.

Within a consumer group, each message is processed by only one consumer, enabling load balancing by distributing the workload across consumers.


### Partition assignment

Each partition in a topic is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group. A consumer can consume messages from multiple partitions. This allow for parallel processing across the consumer group.

For example, let's say you have:
- 4 partitions
- 2 consumers in a group

Kafka might assign:
- Consumer A → Partitions 0 and 2
- Consumer B → Partitions 1 and 3

If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers won't receive any messages. It's important to balance the number of partitions and consumers to ensure efficient message processing.


## Consumer Offsets

A **consumer offset** is a marker that indicates the position of the last event consumed by a consumer in a partition.

Kafka tracks offsets to ensure that consumers can resume from where they left off in case of a failure or restart.

If one of the consumers crashes, no messages are lost.
