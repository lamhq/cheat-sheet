# RxJS

## Introduction

RxJS is a library that provides tools for working with asynchronous data streams.


## Key features

- **Declarative Operators:** Use pure functions like `map`, `filter`, and `switchMap` to transform and coordinate data streams without complex loops.
- **Multicasting (Subjects):** Share a single data execution among multiple subscribers simultaneously, acting like a central event bus.
- **Concurrency Management:** Handle overlapping asynchronous tasks with strategies to cancel, queue, or run requests in parallel.
- **Lazy Evaluation:** Observables remain dormant and consume no resources until a subscriber explicitly starts the execution.
- **Built-in Error Handling:** Gracefully recover from failures or automatically re-attempt failed operations using the `retry` operator.


## Example

Let's look at a **Search-as-you-type** feature.

Requirements:
1. Wait for the user to stop typing (so you don't hit the API on every keystroke).
2. Don't search if the text is the same as the last search.
3. If a new search starts, kill the previous pending request (preventing race conditions).

The Standard JS Way:
```javascript
let timeout;
let lastQuery = '';
let controller; // For aborting fetch

input.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
  const query = e.target.value;
  clearTimeout(timeout);

  timeout = setTimeout(async () => {
    if (query === lastQuery) return;
    lastQuery = query;

    if (controller) controller.abort(); // Cancel previous request
    controller = new AbortController();

    try {
      const res = await fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`, { signal: controller.signal });
      const data = await res.json();
      render(data);
    } catch (err) { /* Handle abort/errors */ }
  }, 300);
});
```

With RxJS, it handles the timing, filtering, and cancellation internally via operators:

```javascript
import { fromEvent, map, debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, switchMap } from 'rxjs';

fromEvent(input, 'input').pipe(
  map(e => e.target.value),          // 1. Get value
  debounceTime(300),                 // 2. Wait for 300ms pause
  distinctUntilChanged(),            // 3. Only if value changed
  switchMap(query => fetchApi(query)) // 4. Switch to new request & cancel old
).subscribe(data => render(data));
```

- **No Global Variables:** You don't need to track `timeout` or `lastQuery` in the outer scope.
- **Automatic Cancellation:** `switchMap` is the "magic" operator. If a new value arrives while the `fetch` is still pending, it automatically unsubscribes from the old one, cancelling the network request.
- **Readability:** The logic reads like a recipe (top-to-bottom) rather than a mess of nested `if` statements and timers.


## Concepts

- **Observable** (Producer): A blueprint for a stream of data that can emit multiple values over time.
- **Observer** (Consumer): A collection of callbacks (`next`, `error`, `complete`) that listens to the Observable.
- **Operators** (Processors): Pure functions (like `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`) used to transform or combine streams.
- **Subscription**: The execution of an Observable; it’s what you "turn on" to start receiving data.
- **Subject**: A special type of Observable that can multicast a value to many Observers at once.
- **Scheduler**: The "traffic controller" that manages the timing and execution context of the data.


## Stream

A stream is a sequence of values emitted over time, like events flowing through a program. Streams can:

- Emit multiple values and never complete (e.g., click events, `setInterval`).
- Emit a single value and complete (e.g., `setTimeout`, HTTP request).
- Emit a fixed number of values before completing (e.g., an array).

A stream can:

- Complete: Ends its lifecycle without errors and stops emitting values.
- Error: Ends with an error and stops emitting values.

Completion and errors are mutually exclusive:

- A completed stream cannot error afterward.
- An errored stream cannot complete.
