# Python

## Version

This document is for version 3.10+.


## Overview

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity.

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.


## Features

- **Open-source**: Python is free to use and distribute, with a large community contributing to its development.
- **Interpreted**: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime (rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand) which makes debugging easier.
- **Object-oriented**: Supports concepts like classes and objects, which help in organizing code.
- **Dynamically Typed**: You don't need to declare the type of a variable; Python figures it out at runtime.
- **Garbage collection**: automatically managing memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.


## Use cases

1. **Data Science and Analysis**: Python is widely used in data science for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
2. **Finance**: Python is used in the finance industry for quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial modeling.
3. **Machine Learning and AI**: Python's simplicity and extensive libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn make it a preferred language for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects.
4. **Automation and Scripting**: Python is often used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, web scraping, and data entry.
5. **Web Development**: Python frameworks like Django and Flask are popular for building web applications.
