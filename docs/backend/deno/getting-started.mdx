# Getting Started

## Installation

Install Deno on macOS using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install deno
```


## Creating project

Generate a new project:
```sh
deno init my_project
```

This will create a new directory called `my_project` with the following structure:

```
my_project
├── deno.json
├── main_test.ts
└── main.ts
```
- `deno.json` file is created to configure your project
- `main.ts` file is where you'll write your application code
- `main_test.ts` file is where you can write tests

Run your project:
```sh
deno main.ts
```

Run your tests:
```sh
deno test
```
