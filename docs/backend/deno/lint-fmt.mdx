# Linting and formatting

## Linting

Deno’s built-in linter supports recommended set of [rules](https://docs.deno.com/lint/) from ESLint to provide comprehensive feedback on your code.

```sh
deno lint
```


## Formatting

Deno’s built-in formatter uses the powerful dprint engine to ensure that your code is always clean, readable, and consistent.

```sh
deno fmt
```

Check and report any formatting issues without modifications:

```sh
deno fmt --check
```
