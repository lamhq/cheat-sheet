# Playwright

Configure ESLint to lint Playwright test files.

Install the [eslint-plugin-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/) plugin:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install --save-dev eslint-plugin-playwright" />


Update ESLint config file:

```js title="eslint.config.js" {2,9}
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";
import playwright from 'eslint-plugin-playwright'

export default defineConfig([
  {
    name: 'Playwright tests',
    files: ['tests/**/*.spec.ts'],
    extends: [
      playwright.configs['flat/recommended']
    ],
  },
]);
```
