# Linter

## Rules

A rule emits a diagnostic when it encounters a code that doesnâ€™t meet its requirements.

A rule emits diagnostics with a `info`, `warn` or `error` severity.

Diagnostics with an `error` severity cause the command to exit with a non-zero code.

Rules are divided into groups.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off",
        "noConsoleLog": "info"
      },
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "warn",
        "useNamingConvention": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Many rules provide a code fix that can be automatically applied. 

Biome distinguishes between safe and unsafe code fixes:
- Safe fixes are guaranteed to not change the semantic of your code. To apply safe fixes, use `--write`
- Unsafe fixes may change the semantic of your program. To apply both safe fixes and unsafe fixes, use `--write --unsafe`.

```sh
npx @biomejs/biome lint --write ./src
npx @biomejs/biome lint --write --unsafe ./src
```


## Disable a rule

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "suspicious": {
        "noDebugger": "off",
        "noConsoleLog": "info"
      },
      "style": {
        "noShoutyConstants": "warn",
        "useNamingConvention": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Configure rule options

A few rules have options that you can change:
- `level` will indicate the severity of the diagnostic;
- `options` will change based on the rule.

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useNamingConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "strictCase": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Disable rule

Ignore a lint rule for a specific line of the code:
```js
// biome-ignore lint: reason
debugger;
// biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noDebugger: reason
debugger;
```
