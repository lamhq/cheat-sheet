## JavaScript heap out of memory error

When running Javascript process using Node (build, install dependencies, cli tools, ... ), you may see this error:
```
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

The error occurs when JavaScript has a lot of processes to handle, and the default allocated memory by Node is not enough to finish the running process.

To fix this error, add the `--max-old-space-size` option to higher value:
```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 #8GB
```
