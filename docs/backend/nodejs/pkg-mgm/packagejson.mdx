# `package.json`

## Overview

The `package.json` file is a JSON file that contains important metadata about a Node.js project.

This file helps the package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn) know how to handle your project, from installing dependencies to running specific scripts.

Key components:

- **name**: The name of your project.
- **version**: The current version of your project.
- **description**: A short description of your project.
- **main**: The entry point of your application (typically a file path).
- **scripts**: Scripts that you can run with npm, such as `start`, `test`, `build`, etc.
- **dependencies**: Lists all the packages your project depends on to run.
- **devDependencies**: Lists packages needed only during development, like testing or build tools.
- **keywords**: An array of keywords related to your project to help people find it.
- **author**: The author of the project.
- **license**: The license under which your project is released.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My first Node.js app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "express"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```


## `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

**dependencies** and **devDependencies** are sections that list the modules your project needs.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "react": "^17.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.10.0",
    "mocha": "^8.2.1"
  }
}
```


### `dependencies`
- Contain essential modules required for your project to run in production.
- They are installed when you run `npm install`.
- Examples include libraries like React, Vue, ...

### `devDependencies`
- These are modules needed only during the development and testing phases.
- They are not included in the final production build.
- Examples include testing frameworks like Mocha, ESLint for linting, or Webpack for bundling.


## Compatible ranges

You can use several operators provided by npm to define the constraints of compatible dependency versions in `package.json` file.


### Caret (`^`)

The caret allows compatibility with all future **MINOR** and **PATCH** versions within the same MAJOR version:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "example-package": "^1.0.0"
}
```
- Compatible with `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.2.3`, etc.
- Does NOT include `2.0.0` or higher.


### Tilde (`~`)

The tilde limits compatibility to PATCH versions within the same MINOR version:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "example-package": "~1.0.0"
}
```
- Compatible with `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.5`, etc.
- Does NOT include `1.1.0` or higher.


### Exact Version

To lock a dependency to an exact version:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "example-package": "1.0.0"
}
```
- Only compatible with `1.0.0`.


### Range Operators

To specify a range explicitly:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "example-package": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"
}
```
- Allows all versions from `1.0.0` to `1.x.x`, but excludes `2.0.0`.


### Wildcard (`*`)

To match any version:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "example-package": "1.*"
}
```
- Allows any `1.x.x` version.
