# pnpm

## About

pnpm (Performant Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript.

It's particularly loved for its speed and reliability compared to npm and Yarn.

## Why pnpm

- Saving disk space.
- Boosting installation speed. 2x faster than npm.
- Avoids dependency conflicts by creating a non-flat `node_modules` structure.


## Installation

Install pnpm to your machince using standalone script. It allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

You can install a specific version:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | env PNPM_VERSION=<version> sh -
```

### Making alias

`pnpm` might be hard to type, so you may use a shorter alias like `pn` instead.

For POSIX systems (like macOS), just put the following line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`:
```sh
alias pn=pnpm
```


## Set up project to use pnpm

Enfoce PNPM as project's package:

```sh title=".npmrc"
package-manager=pnpm@10.0.0 
```

Declares which versions of Node.js and pnpm your project supports.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22.12.0",
    "pnpm": ">=10.0.0"
  }
}
```


## Migrate from other package managers

Generate a `pnpm-lock.yaml` from another package manager's lockfile.

Supported source files:
- `package-lock.json`
- `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- `yarn.lock`

```sh
pnpm import
```
