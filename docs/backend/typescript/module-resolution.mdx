# Module Resolution

## Overview

Module resolution is the process the compiler uses to figure out what an import refers to.


## Relative vs. Non-relative module imports

Module imports are resolved differently based on whether the module reference is relative or non-relative.

A relative import is one that starts with `/`, `./` or `../`:

```ts
import Entry from "./components/Entry";
import { DefaultHeaders } from "../constants/http";
import "/mod"
```

Any other import is considered **non-relative**:

```ts
import * as $ from "jquery";
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
```

A relative import is resolved relative to the importing file and cannot resolve to an ambient module declaration.

A non-relative import can be resolved relative to `baseUrl`, or through **path mappin**g, they can also resolve to ambient module declarations.


## Module Resolution Strategies

1. **Classic**: This was the default in TypeScript before version 1.6. It's not commonly used in modern TypeScript projects.
2. **Node** (default): This mimics the module resolution mechanism in Node.js. It is widely used in modern TypeScript projects.


### Relative import

1. **Relative Path**: TypeScript treats the module path as relative to the file containing the import statement. It starts looking from the directory of the importing file.
2. **File Extensions**: TypeScript tries to resolve the import by appending various file extensions like `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.d.ts`, and `.js` to the module path.
3. **Directory Index Files**: If the module path points to a directory, TypeScript looks for an `index.ts`, `index.tsx`, or `index.d.ts` file within that directory.


### Non-relative import

When TypeScript encounters a non-relative import, it uses the Node resolution strategy to locate the module:
1. **Check Node.js Core Modules**: TypeScript first checks if the module is a core Node.js module (like `fs` or `path`).
2. **Look in `node_modules`**: If it's not a core module, TypeScript looks for the module in the `node_modules` directory. It starts from the directory of the importing file and moves up the directory tree until it finds the module or reaches the root directory.
3. **Use `baseUrl` and `paths`**: If specified in `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript uses the `baseUrl` and `paths` options to resolve the module.

Consider the following project structure:
```
/project
  /src
    - main.ts
  /node_modules
    /lodash
      - index.js
  - tsconfig.json
```

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "lodash": ["node_modules/lodash/index"]
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Node.js Core Modules**: TypeScript first checks if `lodash` is a core Node.js module. It's not, so it moves to the next step.
2. **node_modules Directory**: TypeScript looks for `lodash` in the `node_modules` directory. It finds `node_modules/lodash/index.js`.
3. **baseUrl and paths**: If `lodash` wasn't found in `node_modules`, TypeScript would use the `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration to locate it.


## Configuration Options

### `moduleResolution`

You can configure module resolution in your `tsconfig.json` file using the `moduleResolution` option.

Here are some common values:
- **node**: Uses Node.js-style resolution.
- **classic**: Uses the classic TypeScript resolution strategy.
- **node16** and **nodenext**: For modern Node.js versions, supporting both ECMAScript imports and CommonJS require.
- **bundler**: For use with bundlers, supporting `package.json` "imports" and "exports" without requiring file extensions on relative paths.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```


### `baseURL`

All module imports with non-relative names are assumed to be relative to the `baseUrl`.

Value of `baseUrl` is determined as either command line argument or property in `tsconfig.json`


### Path mapping

Sometimes modules are not directly located under *baseUrl*.

Please notice that `"paths"` are resolved relative to `"baseUrl"`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".", // This must be specified if "paths" is.
    "paths": {
      // These mappings are relative to "baseUrl"
      "jquery": ["node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery"],
      "*": ["*", "generated/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `"*"`: meaning the same name unchanged, so map `<moduleName>` => `<baseUrl>/<moduleName>`
- `"generated/*"`: meaning the module name with an appended prefix `"generated"`, so map `<moduleName>` => `<baseUrl>/generated/<moduleName>`


### `rootDirs`

Using `rootDirs`, you can inform the compiler that there are many "virtual" directories acting as a single root. And thus the compiler can resolve **relative modules imports** within these "virtual" directories

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDirs": ["src/views", "generated/templates/views"]
  }
}
```

`rootDirs` is not limited to specifying a list of physical source directories. The supplied array may include any number of ad hoc, arbitrary directory names, regardless of whether they exist or not.

In below example, the compiler will now resolve `import messages from './#{locale}/messages'` to `import messages from './zh/messages'` for tooling purposes, allowing development in a locale agnostic manner without compromising design time support:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDirs": ["src/zh", "src/de", "src/#{locale}"]
  }
}
```
