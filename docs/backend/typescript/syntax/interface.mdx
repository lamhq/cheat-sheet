# Interfaces

## Overview

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
```

## Extending an Interface

```ts
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}

interface ColorfulCircle extends Colorful, Circle {}

const cc: ColorfulCircle = {
  color: "red",
  radius: 42,
};
```

## Merging Interfaces

You can add new fields to interfaces after creation.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John",
  age: 34,
}
```


## Types or Interfaces?

You should always use Types until you need to use features from Interfaces.

Interfaces have less features than Types:

1. Interfaces can only be used to define type for an object:
    ```ts
    interface AType = string | number; // this's impossible ❌

    type AType = string | number; // this works ✅
    ```
2. Interfaces don't support declaring a union of multiple different types:
    ```ts
    interface OrType = { name: string} | { age: number }; // this's impossible ❌

    type OrType = { name: string} | { age: number }; // this works ✅
    ```

The only main benefit to using interfaces is [merging multiple interfaces](#merging-interfaces) (but it introduces more issues than helping).
