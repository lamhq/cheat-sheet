# GraphQL API

Building GraphQL API with NestJS.

## Overview

NestJS provide the built-in `@nestjs/graphql` module to build GraphQL API.

It can be configured to use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) server (with the `@nestjs/apollo` driver) and [Mercurius](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius) (with the `@nestjs/mercurius`).

You can also build your own dedicated driver.


## Approaches

Nest offers two ways of building GraphQL applications:

### Code first

You use decorators and TypeScript classes to generate the corresponding GraphQL schema.

Pros:
- Reduce the need for manual matching of resolvers
- Easier to manage and scale for large projects
- Ensure type safety throughout development

Cons:
- The schema is embedded and scaterred in multiple code files, which might be harder to understand
- Hard to migrate the API to another programming language

When to use?
- If you prefer to work exclusively with TypeScript.


### Schema first

- You define GraphQL schemas using Schema Definition Language (SDL)
- Nest automatically generates your TypeScript definitions based on the GraphQL schemas

Pros:
- Using SDL makes it readable and understandable for teams with different programming languages
- Having a schema as the blueprint allows front-end and back-end teams to work simultaneously
- This approach aligns with GraphQL's original design philosophy and is widely supported

Cons:
- You need to regenerate TypeScript code whenever schema is changed
- You need to commit both the schema and code

When to use?
- You have a schema (from the design phase) and use it to develop the API
