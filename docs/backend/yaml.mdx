# YAML

## Overview

YAML is a data serialization language.

Easily readable by humans.

It works well with other programming languages and maps easily into native data structures.

It's a viable replacement for languages like JSON.


## Indentation

Use spaces for indentation. Tabs are not allowed.

Stick to a consistent indentation style throughout the file.

The recommended indentation is two spaces per level.

```yml
company:
  name: "Spacelift"
  domain:
    - devops
    - devsecops
tutorial:
  yaml:
    name: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
    type: "awesome"
    born: 2001
  json:
    name: "JavaScript Object Notation"
    type: "great"
    born: 2001
```


## Comments

YAML supports single line comments.

Multi line comments are not supported.

Comments must not appear inside scalars.

```yml
# this is single line comment.
```


## Strings

Plain Strings:
- don't require any special characters to enclose
- can't start with certain characters (like ``, `[]`, `{}`, etc.).
```yml
title: The Great Gatsby
author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
```

Quoted Strings: for strings that include special characters or leading/trailing spaces.
```yml
title: 'The Great Gatsby'
description: 'A story about the jazz age in America.'
```

Double-Quoted Strings: for strings that need to include special characters or escape sequences (like `\n`, `\t`)
```yml
title: "The Great Gatsby"
quote: "She looked at him and smiled, \"Oh, Gatsby!\""
```

Multi-Line Strings:
- Literal Block Scalar: use `|` to preserve newlines
- Folded Block Scalar: use `>` to converts newlines to spaces
```yml
poem: |
  Roses are red,
  Violets are blue,
  YAML is great,
  And so are you.
```

```yml
summary: >
  The Great Gatsby is a novel written by 
  American author F. Scott Fitzgerald 
  that follows a cast of characters.
```


## Numbers

- Integer: `age: 30`
- Float: `height: 5.9`


## Booleans

```yml
isStudent: true
```


## Null

`nickname: null` or `nickname: ~`.


## Sequences (Lists)

A sequence represents a list of items. Each item in the sequence is prefixed by a dash (`-`).
```yml
names:
  - Alice
  - Bob
  - Charlie
```

Inline sequence:
```yml
names: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
```


## Mappings (Dictionaries)

A mapping represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is followed by a colon (`:`) and the corresponding value.
```yml
person:
  name: Alice
  age: 30
  city: New York
```

You can nest sequences and mappings to create complex hierarchical structures.
```yml
company:
  name: "Spacelift"
  departments:
    - name: "Engineering"
      employees:
        - name: Alice
          role: Developer
        - name: Bob
          role: DevOps
    - name: "Marketing"
      employees:
        - name: Charlie
          role: Manager
```


## Tags and Anchors

YAML supports tags and anchors to reference and reuse data.

- Anchors (`&`): Define a reusable node.
- Aliases (`*`): Reference the anchored node.

### Get content
```yml
paul: &paulUser
  name: Paul
  type: user
  enabled: true

books:
  - 1923:
      author: *paulUser
```

Equivalent to:
```yml
books:
  - 1923:
      author:
        name: Paul
        type: user
        enabled: true
```

### Merge content
```yml
default: &defaultAttrs
  type: user
  enabled: true

users:
  - name: Alice
    <<: *defaultAttrs
  - name: Bob
    <<: *defaultAttrs
    enabled: false
```

Equivalent to:
```yml
users:
  - name: Alice
    type: user
    enabled: true
  - name: Bob
    type: user
    enabled: false
```


### Merge array

```yml
.default_scripts: &default_scripts
  - ./default-script1.sh
  - ./default-script2.sh

job1:
  script:
    - *default_scripts
    - ./job-script.sh
```

Equivalent to:

```yml
job1:
  script:
    - ./default-script1.sh
    - ./default-script2.sh
    - ./job-script.sh
```
