# Test Context

## Overview

Test context is a special object passed as the first argument to each test function. It provides metadata, utilities, and fixtures that are scoped to that specific test.

## Built-in Test Context

- `expect`: A version of the expect API bound to the current test, useful for concurrent testing.
- `task` or `meta`: Metadata about the test (like its name).
- `skip`, `annotate`, `signal`: Built-in helpers to control test flow or add annotations.
- `onTestFailed`, `onTestFinished`: Hooks for handling test lifecycle events.

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

test('adds numbers', ({ expect }) => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4)
})
```


## Extending Context

You can use `test.extend()` to define custom fixtures (like mock data or setup functions) and inject them into the context. This makes it easy to reuse setup logic across multiple tests.
