# Setup and Teardown

## Repeating Setup

If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use `beforeEach` and `afterEach`.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  initializeCityDatabase();
});

afterEach(() => {
  clearCityDatabase();
});

test('city database has Vienna', () => {
  expect(isCity('Vienna')).toBeTruthy();
});

test('city database has San Juan', () => {
  expect(isCity('San Juan')).toBeTruthy();
});
```


## One-Time Setup

In some cases, you only need to do setup once, at the beginning of a file. Jest provides `beforeAll` and `afterAll` to handle this situation.

```js
beforeAll(() => {
  // return a promise
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});

afterAll(() => {
  return clearCityDatabase();
});

test('city database has Vienna', () => {
  expect(isCity('Vienna')).toBeTruthy();
});

test('city database has San Juan', () => {
  expect(isCity('San Juan')).toBeTruthy();
});
```


## Scoping

When `before` and `after` blocks are inside a `describe` block, they only apply to the tests within that describe block.

Top-level `beforeEach` is executed before the `beforeEach` inside the `describe` block.

```js
// Applies to all tests in this file
beforeEach(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});

test('city database has Vienna', () => {
  expect(isCity('Vienna')).toBeTruthy();
});

test('city database has San Juan', () => {
  expect(isCity('San Juan')).toBeTruthy();
});

describe('matching cities to foods', () => {
  // Applies only to tests in this describe block
  beforeEach(() => {
    return initializeFoodDatabase();
  });

  test('Vienna <3 veal', () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair('Vienna', 'Wiener Schnitzel')).toBe(true);
  });

  test('San Juan <3 plantains', () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair('San Juan', 'Mofongo')).toBe(true);
  });
});
```


## Order of Execution

Jest executes all `describe` handlers in a test file before it executes any of the actual tests.

Once the `describe` blocks are complete, by default Jest runs all the tests serially in the order they were encountered in the collection phase, waiting for each to finish and be tidied up before moving on.

Jest calls the `before*` and `after*` hooks in the order of declaration. Note that the `after*` hooks of the enclosing scope are called first. 

```js
beforeEach(() => console.log('connection setup'));
beforeEach(() => console.log('database setup'));

afterEach(() => console.log('database teardown'));
afterEach(() => console.log('connection teardown'));

test('test 1', () => console.log('test 1'));

describe('extra', () => {
  beforeEach(() => console.log('extra database setup'));
  afterEach(() => console.log('extra database teardown'));

  test('test 2', () => console.log('test 2'));
});

// connection setup
// database setup
// test 1
// database teardown
// connection teardown

// connection setup
// database setup
// extra database setup
// test 2
// extra database teardown
// database teardown
// connection teardown
```


## Debug

If a test is failing, one of the first things to check should be whether the test is failing when it's the only test that runs. To run only one test with Jest, temporarily change that `test` command to a `test.only`:

```js
test.only('this will be the only test that runs', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});

test('this test will not run', () => {
  expect('A').toBe('A');
});
```

If you have a test that often fails when it's run as part of a larger suite, but doesn't fail when you run it alone, it's a good bet that something from a different test is interfering with this one. You can often fix this by clearing some shared state with `beforeEach`. If you're not sure whether some shared state is being modified, you can also try a `beforeEach` that logs data.
