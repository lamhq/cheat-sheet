# Debugging

## Overview

You can use Chrome DevTools or VSCode to debug Deno programs (which support V8 Inspector Protocol).

To activate debugging capabilities run Deno with one of the following flags:

- `--inspect` allows attaching the debugger at any point in time,
- `--inspect-wait` will wait for debugger to attach and start executing code,
- `--inspect-brk` will wait for the debugger to attach and will pause execution on the first line of code.

```sh
deno run --inspect main.ts
```


## VS Code set up

You can generate a launch configuration by:
1. going to `Run and Debug` panel
2. clicking `create a launch.json file`
3. selecting `Deno` option.
