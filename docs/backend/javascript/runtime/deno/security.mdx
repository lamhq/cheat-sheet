# Security

## Overview

You must explicitly grant access to Deno scripts to access sensitive APIs (such as file system access, network connectivity, or environment access) with command line flags or with a runtime permission prompt.

```sh
deno run --allow-env script.ts

deno run --allow-env=HOME,FOO script.ts
```

During execution of a script, a user can also explicitly grant permission to specific files, directories, network addresses, environment variables, and subprocesses when prompted by the runtime

The `--allow-all` flag grants all permissions to the script and should be used with caution.

```sh
deno run -A script.ts
deno run --allow-all script.ts
```


## Permissions

Check the [official documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/#permissions) for avalable permissions.


## Evaluation of code

Code executed in a Deno runtime can execute **arbitrary code** (using `eval`, `new Function`, dynamic import or web workers).

The code has the same privilege level as the caller code.


## Subprocesses

Code executing inside of a Deno runtime can not spawn subprocesses by default, this can be enabled using the `--allow-run` flag.

Any subprocesses you spawn can access system resources regardless of the permissions you granted to the parent process. This is often referred to as privilege escalation.

If you really need to spawn a specific executable, you can reduce the risk by limiting which programs a Deno process can start by passing specific executable names to the `--allow-run` flag:

```sh
# Allow running all subprocesses
deno run --allow-run script.ts

# Allow running "curl" and "whoami" subprocesses
deno run --allow-run="curl,whoami" script.ts
```
