# Linters & Formatters

## JavaScript Linters

A JavaScript linter is a tool that analyzes your JavaScript code to identify and fix potential issues, ensuring your code adheres to certain style guidelines and best practices.

1. **ESLint**: This is one of the most widely used linters. ESLint is highly configurable and supports custom rules, making it suitable for various projects. It can be integrated into most text editors and CI/CD pipelines.

2. **JSLint**: Created by Douglas Crockford, JSLint is one of the original JavaScript linters. It enforces a very strict coding style and is less configurable compared to ESLint.

3. **JSHint**: A fork of JSLint, JSHint is more flexible and allows for more customization. It helps catch potential errors and enforce coding conventions.

4. **StandardJS**: This linter enforces JavaScript Standard Style, which is a set of rules and conventions for writing JavaScript. It aims to reduce bike-shedding and save time by having a single style guide.
