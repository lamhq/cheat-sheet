# Variable declaration

## `let` and `var`

`let`, `var` and `const` are used to declare variables.

`var`:
- variables are globally scoped or function scoped
- you can re-declare a variable (in the same scope)

`let`:
- variables are block scoped.
- you can't re-declare a variable with `let`

Example:

```js
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;

  if (true) {
    var x = 3; // same variable as above
    let y = 4; // different variable than above
  }

  console.log(x); // 3
  console.log(y); // 2
}
```


## hoisting

With `var`, you can access a variable before declaring it, because the `var` statement get hoisted and moved to the top:

```js
console.log(aa)
var aa = 5
console.log(aa)
```

Output:

```
undefined
5
```

Because it's equivalent to:

```js
var aa
console.log(aa)
aa = 5
console.log(aa)
```

Variables declared with `let/const` do not get hoisted, it will throw an error

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: aa is not defined
```


## `const`

Once you bind a value/object to a variable using `const`, you canâ€™t reassign to that variable.

```js
const x = 1;
x = 2; // This will throw an error

let y = 1;
y = 2; // This is allowed
```
