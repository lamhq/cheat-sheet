# Schema Design Process

## Overview

Following the schema design process helps:
- identify what data your application needs
- how to best organize your data to optimize performance
- make it easier to scale your application in the future

You can design your schema iteratively and modify your schema as the needs of your application change.

You may need to strike a balance between performance and simplicity.

You may want to establish a simple schema to cover basic functionality, before spending time on optimizations.

The schema design process consists of the following steps:
1. **Identify your workload**. Identify the operations that your application runs most frequently
2. **Map relationships**. Identify the relationships in your application's data and decide whether to link or embed related data.
3. **Apply design patterns** to optimize reads and writes.
4. **Create indexes**. Create indexes to support common query patterns


## Identify Application Workload

Knowing your application's most common queries helps you create effective indexes and minimize the number of calls the application makes to the database.

Consider these factors to identify the data your application needs:
- The information users need
- Your business domain
- Application logs and frequently-run queries. 

Create a workload table with your application's queries:

| Action | Query Type | Information | Frequency | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The action that a user takes to trigger the query. | The type of query (read or write). | The document fields that are either written or returned by the query. | How frequently your application runs the query. | How critical the query is to your application. |

> [!NOTE]
> Queries that are run frequently benefit from indexes and should be optimized to avoid lookup operations.

The following example shows a workload table for a blog application:

| Action | Type | Information | Frequency | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Submit a new article | Write | author, text | 10 per day | High |
| Submit a comment on an article | Write | user, text | 1,000 per day (100 per article) | Medium |
| View an article | Read | article id, text, comments | 1,000,000 per day | High |
| View article analytics | Read | article id, comments, clicks | 10 per hour | Low |


## Map Schema Relationships

How you map relationships between data entities affects your application's performance and scalability.

To link related data, you can either:
1. Embed related data within a single document.
2. Store related data in a separate collection and access it with a **reference**.

### Embedded Data

Embedded documents store related data in a single document structure.

A document can contain arrays and sub-documents of related data. This allow applications to retrieve related data in a single database operation.

### References

References store relationships between data by including links, called **references**.

For example, a `user_id` field in an `document` collection indicates a reference to a document in a `user` collection.

### Guidelines

To decide whether to embed related data or use references, consider your application's goals:
- **Improve queries on related data**. embed the data to avoid the need for frequent `$lookup` operations.
- **Improve data returned from different entities**. embed the data of related entities in a single collection.
- **Improve update performance**. Store related data in its own collection and using a reference to access it.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use a reference, you reduce your application's write workload by only needing to update the data in a single place.


### Steps

1. Identify related data
2. Create a schema map for your related data
3. Choose whether to embed related data or use references


### Examples

Consider the following schema map for a blog application:

**Optimize Queries for Articles**: embed related information in the articles collection to return all data needed by the application in a single operation.

```js
const article = {
  title: "My Favorite Vacation",
  date: ISODate("2023-06-02"),
  text: "We spent seven days in Italy...",
  tags: [
    {
      name: "travel",
      url: "<blog-site>/tags/travel",
    },
    {
      name: "adventure",
      url: "<blog-site>/tags/adventure",
    },
  ],
  comments: [
    {
      name: "pedro123",
      text: "Great article!",
    },
  ],
  author: {
    name: "alice123",
    email: "alice@mycompany.com",
    avatar: "photo1.jpg",
  },
}
```

**Optimize Queries for Articles and Authors**: If your application returns article information and author information separately, consider storing articles and authors in separate collections.

```js
article = {
  title: "My Favorite Vacation",
  date: ISODate("2023-06-02"),
  text: "We spent seven days in Italy...",
  authorId: 987,
  tags: [
    {
      name: "travel",
      url: "<blog-site>/tags/travel",
    },
    {
      name: "adventure",
      url: "<blog-site>/tags/adventure",
    },
  ],
  comments: [
    {
      name: "pedro345",
      text: "Great article!",
    },
  ],
};

author = {
  _id: 987,
  name: "alice123",
  email: "alice@mycompany.com",
  avatar: "photo1.jpg",
};
```


## Apply Design Patterns

Schema design patterns are ways to optimize your data model for your application's access patterns.

Each schema design pattern has different use cases and tradeoffs for data consistency, performance, and complexity. *For example, some schema design patterns improve write performance, while others improve read performance.*

> [!CAUTION]
> Implementing a pattern without understanding your application and the data it needs can degrade application performance and cause unnecessary complications to your schema design.


## Create Indexes

A single collection can have a maximum of 64 indexes.

Too many indexes can degrade performance before that limit is reached.

For collections with a high write-to-read ratio, indexes can degrade performance because each insert must also update any indexes.

Steps:
1. Identify common queries. use the `$queryStats` aggregation stage
2. Create indexes to support common queries. Create indexes to support queries on those fields
3. Analyze index use. Analyze your indexes' effectiveness with  `$indexStats` aggregation stage.
