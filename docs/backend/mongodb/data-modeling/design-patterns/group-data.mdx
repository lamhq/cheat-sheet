# Group Data

## Overview

If your schema contains a large series of data, grouping that data into multiple smaller series can improve performance.

To improve performance and organization for groups of data, you can use the **bucket** and **outlier** patterns.


## Bucket Pattern

The Bucket Pattern groups related data into "buckets" rather than storing each individual data point as a separate document.

Separating large data series into smaller groups can improve query access patterns and simplify application logic.

Useful for:
- time-series data, IoT applications, and real-time analytics, where data arrives in continuous streams.
- similar objects that relate to a central entity, such as stock trades made by a single user.

You can use the bucket pattern for pagination by grouping your data based on the elements that your application shows per page.

After you implement the bucket pattern, you don't need to incorporate pagination logic to return results in your application. The way the data is stored matches the way it is used in the application.

### Example

For example, we have a `trades` collection that store stock trades made by users, each trade is stored in a document:

```js
db.trades.insertMany(
  [
    {
      "ticker" : "MDB",
      "customerId": 123,
      "type" : "buy",
      "quantity" : 419,
      "date" : ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z")
    },
    {
      "ticker" : "MDB",
      "customerId": 123,
      "type" : "sell",
      "quantity" : 29,
      "date" : ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z")
    },
    {
      "ticker" : "GOOG",
      "customerId": 456,
      "type" : "buy",
      "quantity" : 50,
      "date" : ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z")
    }
  ]
)
```

The application shows stock trades made by a single customer at a time, and shows `10` trades per page. To simplify the application logic, use the bucket pattern to group the trades by `customerId` in groups of `10`.

```js
db.trades.drop()

db.trades.insertMany(
  [
    {
      "_id": "123_1698349623",
      "customerId": 123,
      "count": 2,
      "history": [
        {
          "type": "buy",
          "ticker": "MDB",
          "qty": 419,
          "date": ISODate("2023-10-26T15:47:03.434Z")
        },
        {
          "type": "sell",
          "ticker": "MDB",
          "qty": 29,
          "date": ISODate("2023-10-30T09:32:57.765Z")
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "_id": "456_1698765362",
      "customerId": 456,
      "count": 1,
      "history": [
        {
          "type" : "buy",
          "ticker" : "GOOG",
          "quantity" : 50,
          "date" : ISODate("2023-10-31T11:16:02.120Z")
        }
      ]
    },
  ]
)
```

- Documents with common `customerId` values are condensed into a single document, with the `customerId` being a top-level field.
- Trades for that customer are grouped into an embedded array field, called `history`.
- The `_id` field value is a concatenation of the `customerId` and the first trade time in seconds (since the unix epoch) in the `history` field.
- The `count` field indicates how many elements are in that document's history array. The `count` field is used to implement pagination logic.

### Query data

To show the first 10 stock trades for customer `123`:

```js
db.trades.find( { "_id": /^123_/ } ).sort( { _id: 1 } ).limit(1)
```

To show data for page `10`, run the following query:
```js
db.trades.find( { "_id": /^123_/ } ).sort( { _id: 1 } ).skip(9).limit(1)
```

### Insert Data

Command to insert a new trade for `customerId: 123`:
```js
db.trades.updateOne(
  { _id: /^123_/, count: { $lt: 10 } },
  {
    $push: {
      history: {
        type: "buy",
        ticker: "MSFT",
        qty: 42,
        date: ISODate("2023-11-02T11:43:10"),
      },
    },
    $inc: { count: 1 },
    $setOnInsert: { _id: "123_1698939791", customerId: 123 },
  },
  { upsert: true }
);
```
- The update searchs for a document with `_id` field match the prefix `123_` and `count` field is less than `10`
- If there is a matching document, the update command pushes the new trade into the matched document's `history` array.
- If there is not a matching document, the update command inserts a new document with the new trade. The `_id` field of the new document is a concatenation of the `customerId` and the time in seconds since the unix epoch of the trade.


## Outlier Pattern

**Problem**: If your collection stores documents of generally the same size and shape, a drastically different document can cause issues with query performance, indexing efficiency, and storage optimization (an outlier).

Example:
