# Handle Computed Values

## Overview

If you want to return calculated data values to your application, by using the **Computed** and the **Approximation** schema patterns you can improve performance by pre-computing and storing the resulting values ahead of time so they are readily available when you request the data.


## Computed Data Pattern

Use the computed pattern when your application performs the same calculations repeatedly and has a high read to write ratio.

Instead of computing values on every read, the application stores the computed value and recalculates it as needed (when computed value's source data changes or periodicly).

The computed pattern reduces CPU workload and increases application performance.


## Approximation Pattern

Use the approximation pattern when you have values that change frequently, but users don't need to know precise values (e.g., City population, Website visits, Airline travelers). 

Instead of updating values every time data changes, the approximation pattern updates data based on a larger granularity. This results in fewer updates and a lower application workload.

*For example, consider tracking a city's population. Instead of updating the population count with every individual change, you can store updates only when the population shifts by a significant amount, such as 100 people:*

```js
function updateStoredPopulation(curr_population, new_population) {
  let population_change = Math.abs(curr_population - new_population);
  if (population_change >= 100) {
    db.population.insertOne({
      city: "New Perth",
      population: new_population,
      date: new Date(),
    });
  }
}
```
