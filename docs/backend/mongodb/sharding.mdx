# Sharding

## Overview

MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding. This method divides a larger database into smaller, more manageable components known as shards.

Each shard is stored on a separate database server instance, which distributes the load and offers an
effective approach to data management.

In MongoDB, data sharding occurs at the collection level (data of a collection is distributed across multiple shards).

Each database in a cluster has its own primary shard that stores all the unsharded collections.


## Shard key

A shard key is made up of one or more document fields.

The data is divided into non-overlapping chunks by breaking down the range of shard key values.

The goal is to evenly distribute these chunks among a cluster's shards, ensuring efficient distribution.


## Shard key index

To shard a populated collection, an index that begins with the shard key is necessary. 

However, for empty collections, MongoDB automatically generates the required supporting index if needed.
