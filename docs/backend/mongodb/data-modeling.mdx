# Data Modeling

## Overview

Data modeling refers to the organization of:
- data within a database
- and the links between related entities.

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema model:
- Documents within a single collection are not required to have the same set of fields.
- A field's data type can differ between documents within a collection.

Examples:
- You can embed department information inside of the `employee` collection to return relevant information in a single query.
- You can store recent reviews in the product data, and older reviews in a separate collection because they are not frequently accessed.
- you can store all products in one collection, using different attributes for each product


## Schema Design comparison

| Relational Database Behavior | Document Database Behavior |
| -- | -- |
| You must determine a table's schema before you insert data. | Your schema can change over time as the needs of your application change. |
| You often need to join data from several different tables to return the data needed by your application. | you store data to match the structured of returned data, and avoid joins |
