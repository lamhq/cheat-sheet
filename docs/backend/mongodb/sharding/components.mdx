# Components

A MongoDB sharded cluster consists of the following key elements:

## `mongos`

Clients establish connections with mongos instances, not shards.

It serves as a query router for client applications. It directs client requests to the appropriate shards and consolidates the results from multiple shards into a final response.

It is recommended to run multiple instances of mongos in production deployments to ensure high availability.

## Config servers

Responsible for storing metadata about the cluster's data distribution.

The metadata includes information about chunks (data partitions) and their allocation across shards.

They are deployed as a replica set to ensure fault tolerance and high availability.

It plays a crucial role in enabling efficient data management and query routing within the cluster.

## Shard

This is a replica set that stores a distinct subset of the overall data in the cluster.
