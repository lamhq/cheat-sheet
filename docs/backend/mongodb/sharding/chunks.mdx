# Chunks

## Overview

MongoDB uses the shard key to partition the data into chunks, owned by a shard.

A chunk consists of a range of sharded data.

A range can be a portion of the chunk or the whole chunk.

The balancer migrates data between shards.

Each chunk has inclusive lower and exclusive upper limits based on the shard key.

## Range Migration

MongoDB migrates data ranges to distribute data (of a collection) evenly among shards.

Migrations may be either:
- Manual. Should be limited.
- Automatic. The balancer automatically migrates data to address uneven distribution of data across the shards.

## Jumbo Chunks

Jumbo Chunks are oversized chunks that exceed the maximum chunk size. These chunks cannot be automatically split by MongoDB, which prevents the balancer from migrating them across shards.

To clear the jumbo flag, you can manually split the chunk; MongoDB removes the flag if splitting succeeds. You can use either the `sh.splitAt()` or `sh.splitFind()` method to split a jumbo chunk.

If you cannot split the chunk, you can modify the shard key (reshard a collection) to make the chunk divisible or you can manually remove the flag.


## Pre-splitting

Pre-splitting ranges involves manually creating and distributing chunks for a sharded collection before inserting data.

When ingesting large volumes of data, pre-splitting can help distribute the data evenly across shards from the beginning.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is advised to only pre-split ranges for empty collections. Attempting to manually split ranges for a non-empty collection can result in irregular range boundaries and sizes, and may also cause the balancing behavior to function inefficiently or crashed.
