# Querying sharded data

## The mongos router

Instead of connecting to the single server or the primary of the replica set, you connect to mongos, which acts as a query router and decides which shard to ask for data.


## `find`

If a query includes the shard key or a prefix of the shard key, mongos will only query the shards that hold the keys you are looking for. Otherwise, mongos query every shard (broadcast operation, aka fan-out queries).

For example, there's a compound shard key for the `user` collection is `_id`, `email`, `country` and three queries:
```js
db.user.find({ _id: 1 })
db.user.find({ _id: 1, "email": "packt@ packt.com" })
db.user.find({ _id: 1, "email": "packt@ packt.com" , "country": "UK" })
```
- the first two queries consist a prefix of the shard key
- the third query consist of the complete shard key
- query on `{ email, country }` or `{ country }` will result in a broadcast operation
 

## `sort`

For sorting results, you have two options:
- If sort criteria include the shard key, `mongos` can efficiently target specific shards for querying.
- Without a shard key, it becomes a fan-out query, the primary shard performs a distributed merge sort locally before sending the sorted results to `mongos`.


## `limit`

A query limit is applied on each shard individually and then again at the `mongos` level to account for results from multiple shards.


## `skip`

A skip operator, cannot be passed on to individual shards and will be applied by `mongos` after retrieving all the results locally.

If you combine the `skip()` and `limit()`, `mongos` will optimize the query by passing both values to individual shards, useful for pagination.

Without `sort()`, mongos retrieves results from multiple shards in a round-robin manner.


## Update and delete

Using the shard key in `updateOne()`, `deleteOne()`, or `findAndmodify()` operations is more efficient (but not required) as it allows for targeted queries.

| Operation | Description |
| -- | -- |
| insert() | Must include the shard key |
 |update() | Can include the shard key, but not mandatory |
| Query with shard key | Targeted operation |
| Query without shard key | A scatter-gather operation behind the scenes |
| Index sorted, query with shard | key Targeted operation |
| Index sorted, query without shard key | Distributed sort merge |
| updateOne(), replaceOne(), deleteOne() | Can use any field to match on, but more efficient with shard key |
