# Replication

## Overview

A replica set refers to a collection of `mongod` processes that uphold the same dataset.

By default, a replica set consists of three nodes, each holding a complete copy of the database.

A replica set can have up to 50 nodes.


## Primary node

Write operations in MongoDB are executed on the primary node and subsequently logged in the primary's oplog.

A replica set can only have one primary node.


## Secondary nodes

The secondary nodes mirror the primary's dataset. They only support read operations.


## Replica set elections

When the primary node become inaccessible, a qualified secondary node will initiate an election to become the new primary.

MongoDB employs a protocol built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm to orchestrate replica set elections. It includes a voting mechanism to select which member will assume the primary role.

Events can initiate an election:
- Adding or removing a node from the replica set
- Initializing the replica set
- A heartbeat failure a secondary nodes and the primary (health check timeout)

The replica set cannot perform write operations until the election is completed. It can still handle read operations.


## Replica set oplog

Write operations are logged in the primary's oplog. Secondary members asynchronously replicate and apply these operations.

Each operation within the oplog is idempotent, meaning that whether applied once or multiple times to the target dataset, oplog operations yield the same outcome.

Every member of the replica set holds a copy of the oplog.

All members of the replica set exchange heartbeats (pings) with each other.

Write operations may lag across nodes due to factors like network latency, hardware, workload. If a node falls behind, it will catch up or resync using the oplog.


## Replica set arbiter

A replica set arbiter is a node that participates in elections but does not store data. It is incapable of becoming a primary.

Its primary role is to help maintain an odd number of voting members in a replica set to prevent deadlocks during primary elections.


## Hidden replica set members

Hidden replica set members are nodes that are part of the replica set but are not visible to client applications.

They are often used for tasks like backups, reporting, or analytics, so they don't interfere with the primary workload or performance.

They contain a complete copy of the database, similar to other members, ensuring data redundancy.

They cannot assume the primary role.

They have a `priority` value of `0`, and `hidden` is `true`.


## Delayed replica set members

Delayed replica set members are hidden replica set members that replicate data from the primary after a specified delay.

They are used to maintain a historical view of the database for scenarios like data recovery or auditing, ensuring access to past states of the data.


## Write concern

The write concern determines how MongoDB confirms write operations on replica sets, it ensures that the data is written to a specified number of nodes before acknowledging the write operation.

The following fields can be included in a write concern:
```js
{ w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> }
```

- **Unacknowledged (`w: 0`)**: The client does not wait for any acknowledgment of the write. This is faster but risky as thereâ€™s no confirmation of success.  
- **Acknowledged (`w: 1`)**: The default setting where the primary node confirms the write before returning success.  
- **Majority (`w: majority`)**: A write is acknowledged only after a majority of replica set members confirm it, ensuring stronger durability.  
- **Custom (`w: n`)**: You can specify the number of nodes required to acknowledge the write.  

Additional options include:  
- **`j: true`**: Ensures that the write is committed to the journal for durability.  
- **Timeout (`wtimeout`)**: Sets a time limit for the write operation to avoid indefinite waiting.  

The choice of write concern can influence both the performance and the durability of the data:
- **Performance**: A lower write concern (e.g., `w: 0`) can enhance performance by reducing the latency of the write operation. However, it risks data durability.
- **Durability**: A higher write concern (e.g., `w: "majority"`) ensures that the data is durable by waiting for acknowledgments from the majority of the nodes. This might introduce a slight latency in the write operation.


## Read preference

Read preference determines how MongoDB clients route read operations to the members of a replica set.

By default, MongoDB directs all read operations to the primary member.

MongoDB supports five read preference modes:
- `primary`: All read operations are directed to the primary member (default).
- `primaryPreferred`: Reads are directed to the primary member if available; otherwise, they are routed to secondary members.
- `secondary`: All read operations are directed to secondary members.
- `secondaryPreferred`: Reads are directed to the available secondary members, if any; otherwise, they are routed to the primary member.
- `nearest`: Read operations are directed to the member with the lowest network latency, irrespective of the member's status.

You can also specify the following options:
- **Tag sets**: target read operations to members that have specific tags
- **Max staleness**: specify how outdated (or "stale") a secondary node can be when serving read operations

The choice of read preference can influence both the performance and the availability of the data:
- **Performance**: Distributing read operations to secondary members can enhance performance by reducing the load on the primary.
- **Availability**: In case of primary unavailability, read operations can still be served by secondary members if the read preference mode allows it.


## Read concern

Read concern determines the consistency and isolation level of data read from the database.

By adjusting the read concern, it's possible to control the visibility of data in read operations, thereby ensuring the desired level of consistency and isolation.

Supported read concern levels:
- `local`: Returns the most recent data available to the MongoDB instance at the start of the
query, irrespective of the state of replication (default).
- `available`: Returns the data that is currently available in the distributed system at the time
of the query. This level provides the most minimal latency but does not guarantee consistency.
- `majority`: Returns data that has been acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members.
This ensures a high level of consistency.
- `linearizable`: Provides the highest level of consistency by returning data that reflects all
successful majority-acknowledged writes that completed prior to the start of the read operation.
- `snapshot`: Returns data from a specific point in time across all replica set members.

The choice of read concern can influence both the consistency and the isolation of the data:
- **Consistency**: Higher levels of read concern (e.g., `majority` or `linearizable`) ensure
that the data returned is consistent across the replica set members.
- **Isolation**: By using the `snapshot` read concern, it's possible to isolate a transaction from
concurrent writes, ensuring a consistent view of the data throughout the transaction.


## Best practices

1. Ensure the replica set has an odd number of voting members to prevent split decisions during network partitions, enabling the larger segment to accept writes.
2. If there are even voting members, add a voting node or an arbiter to avoid deadlocks.
3. Place at least one node in another data center to protect against regional outages.
4. Use hidden or delayed members to support dedicated functions, such as backup or reporting.
