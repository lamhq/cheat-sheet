# Kafka

## Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue.

It can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.

Kafka is very fast and guarantees zero downtime and zero data loss.

Messages are stored for a period of time before deleted.

Messages are replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss.


## Advantages

**Performance**. Kafka can handle a lot of data quickly (can process 100+ events / sec). It maintains stable performance even many TB of messages are stored.

**Reliability**. Kafka is distributed, partitioned, replicated and fault tolerance.

**Scalability**. Kafka messaging system scales easily without down time..

**Durability**. Kafka uses Distributed commit log which means messages persists on disk as fast as possible, hence it is durable..


## Use Cases

**Real-time Data Processing**. Kafka can stream data to analytics platforms, enabling real-time insights and dashboards.

**Log Aggregation**. Kafka can collect logs from multiple services and make them available in a standard format to multiple con-sumers.

**Event Sourcing**. Kafka can capture and store events from various systems, providing a reliable source of truth for monitoring and auditing purposes.

**Monitoring**. Kafka can aggregate statistics from distributed applications, creating centralized feeds of operational data
