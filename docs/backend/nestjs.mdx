# NestJS

## Version

`8.0.4`


## Introduction

Nest (NestJS) is a **framework** for building **Node.js** server-side applications.


## Why NestJS?

It provides a robust development experience:
- **Scalability**: Modular design makes large applications easier to manage.
- **Maintainability**:
  - Clear separation of concerns between controllers, services, and modules.
  - Leverages TypeScript by default.
  - Combines concepts from object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming (FP), and reactive programming (FRP).
- **Community & Ecosystem**: Rapidly growing, with strong documentation and support.
- **Enterprise-ready**: Suitable for complex applications requiring reliability and performance.


## Use Cases

1. Building RESTful APIs.
2. Creating GraphQL servers.
3. Developing real-time applications with WebSockets.
4. Implementing microservices architectures.


## Installation

Install Nest CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -g @nestjs/cli" />

Create a new project with PNPM as the package manager:

It creates a new NestJS project named `project-name` using **pnpm** as the package manager, **TypeScript** as the language, and enables **strict mode** for stronger type checking.

```shell
nest new --package-manager pnpm --language ts --strict project-name
```


## Running the application

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
