# Markdown

## Overview

Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.

All listed syntaxes in this document are supported by Rspress and GitHub.


## Headings

```md
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

## Styling text

Style | Syntax | Keyboard shortcut | Example | Output
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Bold | `** **` or `__ __` | `Command+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) | `**This is bold text**` | **This is bold text**
Italic | `* *` or `_ _` | `Command+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) | `*This text is italicized*` | *This text is italicized*
Strikethrough | `~~ ~~` |   | `~~This was mistaken text~~` | ~~This was mistaken text~~
Bold and nested italic | `** **` and `_ _` |   | `**This text is _extremely_ important**` | **This text is _extremely_ important**
All bold and italic | `*** ***` |   | `***All this text is important***` | ***All this text is important***


## Quoting text

```md
> Text that is a quote
```

## Quoting code

Inline code: you can parts of a string as code with single backtick \`

```md
Use `git status` command.
```

For code block, use triple backticks:

````md
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
````

## Links

```md
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
```

Section links:

```md
Link to the sample section: [Link Text](#sample-section).
```

Relative links:

```md
Refer [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
```

## Line breaks

To create a line break:
1. Include two spaces at the end of the first line.
   ```md
   This example  
   Will span two lines
   ```
2. Include a backslash at the end of the first line.
   ```md
   This example\
   Will span two lines
   ```
3. Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.
   ```md
   This example<br/>
   Will span two lines
   ```

If you leave a blank line between two lines, it will render two lines:
```md
This example

Will be rendered as two `<p>` tags
```


## Images

## Lists

Unordered list:
```md
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
```

Ordered list:
```md
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
```

To create nested list, type **spac**e characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (`-`) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it:
```md
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

## Task lists

```md
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:
```

- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740

## Footnotes

```md
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.
```
