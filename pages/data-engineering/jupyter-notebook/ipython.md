# IPython and Jupiter

## Overview

The IPython is an enhanced Python interpreter.

It encourages an *execute-explore* workflow instead of the typical *edit-compile-run* workflow of many other programming languages. Since much of data analysis coding involves exploration, trial and error, and iteration, IPython can help you get the job done faster.

It also provides integrated access to your operating system's shell; reduces the need to switch between a terminal window and a Python session.

The IPython is used as a kernel (a programming language mode) for using Python with Jupyter.


## Installation

```sh
pip install ipython
```


## Usage

Launch the IPython shell:
```sh
ipython
```

Run python program inside the IPython interpreter:
```sh
%run hello_world.py
```
