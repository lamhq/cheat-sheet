# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- A project in GitLab that you would like to use CI/CD for
- Your GitLab account must have the **Maintainer** or **Owner** role for the project.
- [Ensure you have runners available](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/#ensure-you-have-runners-available) to run your jobs.


## Simple pipeline

Below CI pipeline contains three jobs (`build-job`, `test-job1`, `deploy-prod`) that run each time code is pushed to the repository:

```yml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml"
build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $GITLAB_USER_LOGIN!"

test-job1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - sleep 20

deploy-prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This job deploys something from the $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH branch."
  environment: production
```
- `build-job`: Prints the GitLab username of the person who triggered the pipeline.
- `test-job1`: runs the `sleep` command for 20 seconds which simulates a long test
- `deploy-prod`: prints the current Git branch.


## Deploy pipeline

Below CI pipeline contains two jobs that deploy to `dev` and `prod` environments.

```yml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to $ENV environment"
  environment:
    name: $ENV

deploy-to-dev:
  extends: deploy
  variables:
    ENV: dev
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH'

deploy-to-prod:
  extends: deploy
  variables:
    ENV: prod
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
  when: manual
  before_script:
    - echo "Waiting for approval to deploy to production"
```
- `deploy` job create an environment with name from a variable `ENV`
- `deploy-to-dev` and `deploy-to-prod` extend the `deploy` job
- `deploy-to-dev`:
  - is triggered when any commits push to default branch
  - define a variable `ENV` with value `dev`
- `deploy-to-prod`:
  - is triggered when new tags created on default branch
  - define a variable `ENV` with value `prod`
- the `prod` environment need to be configured for manual approval before running the deployment


## Node.js pipeline

```yml
stages:     # List of stages for jobs and their order of execution
  - build
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build   # Set this job to run in the `build` stage
  image: node
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "build/"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'  # Run for all changes to a merge request's source branch
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH       # Run for all changes to the default branch

pages:
  stage: deploy  # Set this new job to run in the `deploy` stage
  script:
    - mv build/ public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "public/"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH      # Run for all changes to the default branch only
```
- `stages`: groups of jobs
  - jobs in the same stage run in parallel
  - jobs in later stages wait for jobs in earlier stages to complete
  - if a job fails, the whole stage is considered failed. Later stages do not start running.
- `state`: define stages for each job
- `image`: Tell the runner which Docker image to use to run the job. In this case, latest `node` image.
- `artifacts`: share generated files of `build-job` with other jobs.
  - You can browse the contents of the artifacts file by selecting **Browse** to the right of the job log after the job completes.
- `rules`: configure when to run the job . Rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and if a rule matches, the job is added to the pipeline.
  - The site should only deploy for changes to the default branch.
  - The other jobs should run for all changes in merge requests or the default branch.
