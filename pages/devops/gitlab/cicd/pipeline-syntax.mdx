# Pipeline Syntax

## Reuse configuration

### Using `default` and `extends`

```yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

default:               # Add a default section to define the `image` keyword's default value
  image: node

.standard-rules:       # Make a hidden job to hold the common rules
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

build-job:
  extends:
    - .standard-rules  # Reuse the configuration in `.standard-rules` here
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "build/"

pages:
  stage: deploy
  image: busybox       # Override the default `image` value with `busybox`
  dependencies:
    - build-job
  script:
    - mv build/ public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "public/"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```
- `default`: Configuration apply to all jobs when not defined. Define the default `image` as `node`
- `.standard-rules`: a hidden job. Jobs that start with `.` are never added to a pipeline. Use them to hold configuration you want to reuse.
- `extends`: repeat configuration of a hidden job in the current job


### Using `include` and `extends`

To reuse configuration from different configuration files, combine `include` and `extends`.

In the following example, a `script` is defined in the `included.yml` file. Then, it is refered in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by `extends`.

```yml filename="included.yml"
.template:
  script:
    - echo Hello!
```
- `.template`: a hidden job, won't be executed directly

```yml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml"
include: included.yml

useTemplate:
  image: alpine
  extends: .template
```
- `included.yml` is included using the `include` keyword
- `extends: .template`: extend the `useTemplate` job with the properties of the `.template` job.


### Using `!reference` tags

`!reference` tags allow selecting configuration from other sections.

You can use `!reference` tags to reuse configuration from included configuration files as well.

```yml filename="configs.yml"
.setup:
  script:
    - echo creating environment
```

```yml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml"
include:
  - local: configs.yml

.teardown:
  after_script:
    - echo deleting environment

test:
  script:
    - !reference [.setup, script]
    - echo running my own command
  after_script:
    - !reference [.teardown, after_script]
```
- `include` statement is used to add the `configs.yml` file. This allows access to the `.setup` job defined in `configs.yml`.
- `!reference [.setup, script]`: include content of the `script` section of the `.setup` job
- `!reference [.teardown, after_script]`: include content of the `after_script` section of the `.teardown` job

Custom YAML tags like `!reference` might be treated as invalid by your editor, you can [configure some editors to accept `!reference` tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/yaml_optimization.html#configure-your-ide-to-support-reference-tags).
