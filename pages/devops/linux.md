# Linux

## Unix

Unix is a powerful and multitasking operating system that behaves like a bridge between the user and the computer.

Launched in 1960, and was released by AT&T Bell Labs.

It belongs to the Unix family.

Majorly used on workstations and servers.

Examples of unix are IBM AIX, Darwin, Solaris, HP-UX, macOS X, etc.

Unix is not totally free (some versions are free, other than that is expensive).


## Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system.

Supported on several computer platforms and includes multiple software features that handle computer resources, and allow you to do tasks.

Linux is known for its reliability and infrequent crashes. 

It belongs to the **Unix-like** family (many commands in Unix and Linux behave similarly).

Used in several systems like desktop, smartphones, mainframes and servers.

Examples of Linux are: Fedora, Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Android, etc.

Linux is free and its corporate support is available at a price.

Linux is technically just the kernel.


## Motivation

Linux is launched by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991.

At the start, Linux was just enough to boot up the computer and nothing else (just a kernel).

And at the time, Unix was costly and popular.

Linus wanted to lower the costs so everyone could use a Unix-like operating system.


## GNU Project

GNU is a recursive acronym that stands for "GNUâ€™s Not UNIX".

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 by Richard Stallman to develop a complete UNIX-like operating system.

Its mission is to empower computer users by creating and publishing **free software** that grants everyone the rights to **run**, **copy**, **distribute**, **study**, and **modify** it. 

The GNU Project developed nearly everything needed for a complete operating system except for the operating system kernel.


## GNU software

The GNU software is one of the basic parts of any Linux distribution.

Nearly all the tasks you perform in a Linux system involve one or more GNU software packages.

Well-known GNU software packages:

- `bash`: The default shell (command interpreter) in Linux
- `gcc`: Compilers for C, C++, Objective C, and other languages
- `GNOME`: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for a wide variety of tasks that a Linux user may perform
- `grep` package: Includes the `grep`, `egrep`, and `fgrep` commands, which are used to find lines that match a specified text pattern
- `gzip`: A GNU utility for compressing and decompressing files
- `tar`: A tape archiving program that includes multivolume support 
## GNU General Public License

All GNU software was distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), essentially requires:
- the software is distributed in source-code form
- any user may copy, modify, and distribute the software
to anyone else in source-code form. 
- users may have to pay for their individual copies of GNU software.
