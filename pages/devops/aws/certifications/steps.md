## Exam Time

Strategies to help you take control of your journey through the AWS certification exam:

### Preparation before the Exam

Create a Q/A grid of possible responses for each question. As you go, mark each response cell with :
  - `X` - known to be wrong
  - `O` - known to be correct
  - `?` - unknown

When reviewing, ignore responses marked `X` and `O`, focus on `?`.

### Managing Time during the Exam

For the associate exam where you have 80 minutes total to finish. 1 minute is suggested per question. It leaves you 20 minutes for buffer and review.

The pro and specialty exam gives you 170 minutes to complete. 1.75 min/question + 30 min buffer & review.

Set milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Check against milestones to see if you are on track.

Always double-check your anseers before proceeding even if you're a bit behind your pace.

### Reviewing the Exam
- Use review marking checkbox.
- Move on if you can't remember anything
- Check your answers, including the responses that you didn't choose
- Submit the exam only if you have no time left


## After exam
