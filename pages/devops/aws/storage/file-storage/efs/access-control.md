# Access Control

You can control who can administer your file system using IAM (user-based and resource-based policies)

You can control the NFS clients that can access your file systems (resource-based policies).

You can control access to files and directories with POSIX-compliant user and group-level permissions.

POSIX permissions allow you to restrict access from hosts by user and group.

EFS Security Groups act as a firewall, and the rules you add define the traffic flow.
