# AWS Backup

## Overview

Backup allows you to **consolidate backups** across multiple AWS services (EC2, EBS, EFS, Amazon FSx for Lustre/Windows, AWS Storage Gateway).

It can include other services, such as database technologies like RDS and DynamoDB.

You can use AWS Backup with **Organizations** to back up your different AWS services across multiple AWS accounts.


## Benefits

### Central Management

Use a single, central backup console, allowing you to centralize your backups across multiple AWS services and multiple AWS accounts.

### Improved Compliance

Backup policies can be enforced while backups can be encrypted both at rest and in transit, allowing alignment to regulatory compliance.

Auditing is made easy due to a consolidated view of backups across many AWS services.

### Automation

You can create automated backup schedules and retention policies. You can also create lifecycle policies, allowing you to expire unnecessary backups after a period of time.
