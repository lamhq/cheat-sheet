# AWS Free Tier

## Overview

The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) allows you to use certain AWS services without incurring costs, up to specified limits and period. 


## Types

There are three types of free offers:
- Always Free
- 12 Months Free
- Trials

For each free tier offer, make sure to review the specific details about exactly which resource types are included. 

### Always Free

These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.

> For example, AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.
>
> Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.


### 12 Months Free

These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.

Examples include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.


### Trials

Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.

> For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial.
>
> Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.
