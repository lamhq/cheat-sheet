# AWS Pricing Concepts

## How AWS Pricing Works

### Pay for what you use

For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.


### Pay less when you reserve

Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

> For example, suppose that your company is using Amazon EC2 instances for a workload that needs to run continuously. You might choose to run this workload on Amazon EC2 Instance Savings Plans, because the plan allows you to save up to 72% over the equivalent On-Demand Instance capacity.


### Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more

Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

For example, the more Amazon S3 storage space you use, the less you pay for it per GB.


## AWS Pricing Calculator

The [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.

You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

> Suppose that your company is interested in using Amazon EC2. However, you are not yet sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient for your use case.
>
> In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input/output (I/O) requirements. By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.


## Billing Dashboard
