# Support Plans

## Overview

AWS offers four different [Support plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/) to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services.

You can choose from the following Support plans to meet your company's needs:

- Basic
- Developer
- Business
- Enterprise On-Ramp
- Enterprise


## Basic Support

Basic Support is free for all AWS customers. It includes access to whitepapers, documentation, and support communities.

You can also contact AWS for billing questions and service limit increases.

You have access to a limited selection of AWS Trusted Advisor checks.

You can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard, a tool that provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you.


## Developer Support

Additional features:
- Best practice guidance
- Client-side diagnostic tools
- Building-block architecture support, which consists of guidance for how to use AWS offerings, features, and services together.

> For example, suppose that your company is exploring AWS services. You’ve heard about a few different AWS services. However, you’re unsure of how to potentially use them together to build applications that can address your company's needs. In this scenario, the building-block architecture support that is included with the Developer Support plan could help you to identify opportunities for combining specific services and features.


## Business Support

Additional features:

- Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs
- All AWS Trusted Advisor checks
- Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components

> Suppose that your company has the Business Support plan and wants to install a common third-party operating system onto your Amazon EC2 instances. You could contact AWS Support for assistance with installing, configuring, and troubleshooting the operating system. For advanced topics such as optimizing performance, using custom scripts, or resolving security issues, you may need to contact the third-party software provider directly.


## Enterprise On-Ramp Support

Additional features:

- A pool of Technical Account Managers to provide proactive guidance and coordinate access to programs and AWS experts

## Technical Account Manager (TAM)

The Enterprise On-Ramp and Enterprise Support plans include access to a Technical Account Manager (TAM).

The TAM is your primary point of contact at AWS. AMs provide expert engineering guidance, help you design solutions that efficiently integrate AWS services, assist with cost-effective and resilient architectures, and provide direct access to AWS programs and a broad community of experts.

> For example, suppose that you are interested in developing an application that uses several AWS services together. Your TAM could provide insights into how to best use the services together. They achieve this, while aligning with the specific needs that your company is hoping to address through the new application.
