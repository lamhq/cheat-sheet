# AWS Proton

## Overview

AWS Proton is a service that creates and manages infrastructure and deployment tooling for users as well as serverless and container-based applications.

It **automates Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) provisioning and deployments.

You define standardized infrastructure for your serverless and container-based apps. Then use templates to define and manage app stacks that contain ALL components.

AWS Proton automatically provisions resources, configures CI/CD, and deploys the code.

It supports AWS CloudFormation and Terraform IaC providers.
