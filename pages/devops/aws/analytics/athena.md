# Amazon Athena

## Overview

Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to **analyze data in S3 using SQL**.

It's the only service that allows you to directly query data in your S3 bucket (without loading it into a database).

Most results are delivered within seconds.

You pay only for the queries that you run.


## How it works?

To use Athena, you point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying by using standard SQL.

You donâ€™t need complex ETL jobs to prepare your data for analysis.


## Architecture diagram

To start, unstructured data is stored in S3 and needs to be formatted for easy querying.

Glue can be used to create a catalog and structure for the data.

Redshift Spectrum can be used to query data without loading it into the Redshift database, while Athena can run queries on Glue-structured data without loading it into any database.

QuickSight can be used to visualize the data and create a dashboard for insights.
