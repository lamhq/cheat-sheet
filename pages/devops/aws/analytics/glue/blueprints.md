# Developing blueprints in AWS Glue

## Overview

AWS Glue enables you to define blueprints, which you can use to generate workflows.

A blueprint accepts parameters, so that from a single blueprint, a data analyst can create different workflows to handle similar ETL use cases. 

*For example, your organization might have a set of similar ETL use cases that could benefit from being able to parametrize a single workflow to handle them all. After you create a blueprint, you can reuse it for different departments, teams, and projects.*
