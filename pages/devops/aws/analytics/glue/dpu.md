# DPU

## Overview

**DPUs** (Data Processing Units) are a measure of capacity used to execute ETL tasks.

Each DPU consists of 4 vCPUs (virtual CPUs) and 16 GB of memory.

When running an AWS Glue job, you can allocate a certain number of DPUs. The actual number of DPUs you allocate depends on your job requirements and the complexity of the data processing task.
