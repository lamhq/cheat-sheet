# Principle of Least Privilege

Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. 

Primarily, this principle limits the damage that can result from an accident or error.

It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs to the minimum for correct operation, so that unintentional, unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur.
