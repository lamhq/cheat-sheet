# AWS Certificate Manager

## Overview

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) allows you to create, manage, and deploy public and private SSL certificates for use with other AWS services.

It allows you to easily manage and deploy SSL certificates in your AWS environment.

It integrates with Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, API Gateway, etc.


## Benefits

**Free service**. No more paying for SSL certificates! ACM provisions both public and private certificates for free. You will still pay for the resources that utilize your certificates (Elastic Load Balancing, ...).

**Automated Renewals and Deployment**. Certificate Manager can automate the renewal of your SSL certificate and then automatically update the new certificate with ACM-integrated services (Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, and API Gateway, ...)

**Easier to Set Up**. Removes a lot of the manual process, such as generating a key pair or creating a certificate signing request (CS). You can create your own SSL certificate with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console.
