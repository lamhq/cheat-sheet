# Rules

## Rate-based rule

A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action on IPs with rates that go over a limit.

You can put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that's sending excessive requests.

*For example, you can block all IPs that have more than 2,000 requests per 5-minute time span*.
