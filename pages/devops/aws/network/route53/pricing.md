# Pricing

No upfront fees or minimum commitments.

You are charged for:
- Managed Hosted Zones
- DNS Queries
- Managed Domain Names
- Health Checks.
- Traffic Flow.

## Hosted Zones

You pay a monthly charge for each managed hosted zone (no partial months).

A hosted zone deleted within 12 hours of creation is not charged (queries are charged).


## DNS Queries

For every DNS query answered by Amazon Route 53, you incur charges.

Alias records are free of charge when the records are mapped to one of the following:
- Elastic Load Balancers.
- Amazon CloudFront distributions.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments.
- Amazon S3 buckets that are configured as website endpoints.

Latency-based routing queries are more expensive.

Geo DNS and geo-proximity also have higher prices.

You do not pay for the records that you add to your hosted zones.

Health checks are charged with different prices for AWS vs non-AWS endpoints.


## Domain Names

When you register a domain name via or transfer it into Route 53, you pay an annual charge for each domain name.

The pricing for domain names varies based on the Top-Level Domain (TLD).
