# Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)

Leveraging Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) for Ledger Databases

## What Is a Ledger Database?

It's a NoSQL database that is immutable, transparent, and has a cryptographically verifiable transaction log that is owned by one authority.

You cannot update a record (i.e., replace old content) in a ledger database. Instead, an update adds a new record to the database.

Use cases:

- It's used for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
- Shipping companies use it to track items, boxes, shipping containers, deliveries, etc.
- Pharmaceutical companies use it to track creation and distribution of drugs and ensure no counterfeits are produced.
