# Develop Lambda functions

There are several ways to develop AWS Lambda functions:
- AWS Lambda Console: create and manage Lambda functions directly from the AWS Management Console
- Tools like Serverless Frameworks, AWS SAM Framework, Zappa helps simplify the process of deploying and managing serverless applications, including Lambda functions
- For local development: Docker or [LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) can be used to develop and test Lambda functions locally before deploying them to AWS
