# Lambda Layers

## Overview

A layer is a ZIP archive that contains code, or data, that can be linked to Lambda functions.

On invocation, the layer will be extracted into the `/opt` directory in the function execution environment. Each runtime (Node,js, Python, ...) looks for libraries in a different location under `/opt`, depending on the language.

Using a layer should have little impact to invocation time, only deployment time.

A function can use up to **5** layers at a time.

The total unzipped size of the function and all layers cannot exceed **250 MB**.

## Benefits

- Reduce size of function deployment packages
- Speed up code deployments
- Easy sharing of common functionality, libraries, or data


## Layer versions

A layer is a series of immutable versions.

Any update to a layer creates a new version.

New layers start at version number 1.

Each version has a unique ARN.

You must specify the exact version ARN when adding a layer to a function.

Versions can be deleted.

## Public layers

There are many layers created and published publicly that you can use.

### AWS Parameters and Secrets Lambda extension

AWS created.

Can be used for accessing Secrets manager and Parameters store
with a built-in cache.


### Lambda Powertools

AWS created.

Adds many different utilities such as tracing, validation, logging, and much more.

### Lambda Insights

AWS created.

Collects system level metrics for utilizing in CloudWatch.


## Packaging your layer

Bundle all of your layer content into a `.zip` file archive

Your layer content must be able to compile and build in a **Linux environment**.

Here's a docker command that installs python packages for **linux/amd64** architecture:
```sh showLineNumbers
docker run \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v ./build/layer/python:/layer \
  -v ./build/requirements.txt:/requirements.txt \
  -v ~/.cache/pip:/.cache/pip \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  amd64/python:3.11-slim \
  pip install -r /requirements.txt -t /layer
```
- (2): specify the [target platform](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/) for the build output
- (3): mount the destination directory where pakages are downloaded
- (4): mount your requirements file, so pip can read it
- (5): mount the pip cache, to avoid downloading all dependencies each time
- (6): make the installed files and any new cache entries are owned by your user, not root
- (7): image for **python 3.11** using amd64 architecture


## Accessing layer content

Lambda extracts the layer contents into the `/opt` directory in the function execution environment.

Each Lambda runtime adds specific `/opt` directory folders to the `PATH` variable (e.g., `/opt/python`). Your function code can access the layer content without having to specify the full path.

Lambda merges folders with the same name.

If the same file appears in multiple layers, the function uses the version in the last extracted layer.


### Layer paths for each Lambda runtime

To ensure that your layer content gets picked up by the `PATH` variable, include the content in the following folder paths:

Node.js:

- `nodejs/node_modules`
- `nodejs/node14/node_modules`
- `nodejs/node16/node_modules`
- `nodejs/node18/node_modules`

Python:
- `python`
- `python/lib/python3.x/site-packages`
