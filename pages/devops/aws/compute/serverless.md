# AWS Serverless Compute services

## Overview

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which a cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of compute resources.


## Benefits

1. **Reduced operational overhead:** You don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or patching servers.
2. **Improved scalability:** AWS Serverless Services can scale automatically to meet demand.
3. **Lower costs:** You pay only for the resources you use.
4. **Increased agility:** You can develop and deploy applications more quickly.
5. **Higher reliability:** AWS Serverless Services are highly reliable and fault-tolerant.


## Use cases

1. **Web applications:** Build and deploy web applications without having to manage servers.
2. **Mobile applications:** Develop and deploy mobile backend services.
3. **IoT applications:** Process and analyze data from IoT devices.
4. **Data processing:** Process and analyze large datasets.
5. **Machine learning:** Train and deploy machine learning models.
6. **Serverless APIs:** Create and manage APIs without having to manage servers.


## Services

**AWS Lambda**: A compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You only pay for the compute time you consume.

**Amazon API Gateway**: A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

**AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)**: An open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

**AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**: An open-source software development framework to define cloud application resources using familiar programming languages

**AWS Step Functions**: A service that makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.


## Resources

### Serverless Land

[Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com/) is a resource for learning about serverless technology.

It provides information on how to use managed services with event-driven compute functions to minimize infrastructure management and operations.

The site explains that serverless architecture allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server maintenance, scaling, or capacity planning.

The cloud provider handles these aspects, offering high availability and fault tolerance.
