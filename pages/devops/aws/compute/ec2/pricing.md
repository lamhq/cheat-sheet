# Pricing


Besides the normal charges for running an EC2 instance, your AWS account might also be billed hourly amounts or license fees for the use of the AMI software itself.

Pricing options:
- On-Demand
- Reserved Instances
- Spot Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Dedicated Instances

## On-Demand

- Pay for hours or seconds, depending on instance type.
- Low cost and flexibility with no upfront cost.
- Ideal for auto scaling groups and unpredictable workloads.
- Good for dev/test.


## Reserved Instances

- Purchase (or agree to purchase) usage of EC2 instances in advance for significant discounts over On-Demand pricing.
- Discounted rates are automatically applies when you launch an instance that matches your purchased RI.
- Capacity is reserved for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% off the on-demand price.
- Billed whether running or not.
- 3 RI types: Standard, Convertible, and Scheduled.
- Upfront payments can reduce the hourly rate.
- Can switch AZ within the same region.
- Can sell reservations on the  Reserved Instance Marketplace.
- Can be used in Auto Scaling Groups.
- Can be used in Placement Groups.
- Can be shared across multiple accounts within Consolidated Billing.

Modify instance:
- Can change the instance size within the same instance type.
- Instance type modifications are supported for Linux only.
- Cannot change the instance size of Windows RIs.

Standard RI: 
- commitment of 1 or 3 years
- charged whether itâ€™s on or off.
- Up to 60%% off the on-demand price.

Convertible RI:
- similar to Standard Reserved Instances
- has the option to change to a different reserved instance type (equal or greater value).
- Up to 54% off the on-demand price.

Scheduled RI:
- launch within the time window you define
- accrue charges hourly
- billed in monthly increments over the term (1 year).
- match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule.

Ideal for:
- steady state workloads and predictable usage.
- applications that need reserved capacity.

RI Attributes:

- Instance type: designates CPU, memory, networking capability.
- Platform: Linux, SUSE Linux, RHEL, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft SQL Server.
- Tenancy: Default (shared) tenancy, or Dedicated tenancy.
- Availability Zone (optional): if AZ is selected, RI is reserved, and discount applies to that AZ (Zonal RI). If no AZ is specified, no reservation is created but the discount is applied to any instance in the family in any AZ in the region (Regional RI).

After RI term, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:
- Terminate the instance.
- Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance type, Region, tenancy, and platform).


## Spot Instances

You purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%.

Prices fluctuate (move up & down) with supply and demand.

The hourly Spot price varies depending on capacity and region.

Ideal for:
- workloads with flexible start and end times
- any type of computing that don't need persistent storage.
- stateless, fault-tolerant, flexible applications
- tasks that can withstand interruptions, such as background processing job.
- cost sensitive applications

Not good for:
- persistent workloads
- web server, database server
- critical jobs

Use cases:
- big data and analytics
- containerized workloads
- CI/CD and testing
- image and media rendering
- high-performance computing
- algorithmic trading engines


## Dedicated Hosts

- Physical servers dedicated just for your use.
- Most expensive option.
- You have control over which instances are deployed on that host.
- Can be purchased on-demand (hourly) or reservation (up to 70% off the on-demand price).
- Predictable performance.
- Complete isolation.
- Billing is per host.

Use cases:
- Useful if you have server-bound software licenses that use metrics like per-core, per-socket, or per-VM.
- Good for regulatory compliance or licensing requirements.


## Dedicated Instances

- Virtualized instances on hardware just for you.
- Also uses physically dedicated EC2 servers.
- Does not provide the additional visibility and controls of dedicated hosts (e.g. how instances are placed on a server).
- Billing is per instance.
- May share hardware with other non-dedicated instances in the same account.
- Available as On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
- Cost additional $2 per hour per region.


## Limitations

- On-Demand instances across the instance family: 20
- Reserved Instances Purchasing: 20 
- Requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic spot limit per region (by default).


## Pricing Models Comparison

| On-Demand | Reserved | Spot |
|---|---|---|
| No upfront fee | Options: No upfront, partial upfront or all upfront | No upfront fee |
| Charged by hour or second | Charged by hour or second | Charged by hour or second |
| No commitment | 1-year or 3-year commitment | No commitment |
| Ideal for short term needs or unpredictable workloads | Ideal for steady-state workloads and predictable usage | Ideal for cost-sensitive, compute intensive use cases that can withstand interruption |


## Capacity Reservation

**Capacity Reservation** allows you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.

It's ideal if you have strict capacity requirements, and are running business-critical workloads that require a certain level of long or short-term capacity assurance. 

You can create Capacity Reservations at any time, without entering into a one-year or three-year term commitment. The capacity becomes available and billing starts as soon as the Capacity Reservation is provisioned in your account.

To create a Capacity Reservation, you specify the Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity, the number of instances for which to reserve capacity, and the instance attributes (instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS).

Capacity Reservations can only be used by instances that match their attributes. By default, they are automatically used by running instances that match the attributes. If you don't have any running instances that match the attributes of the Capacity Reservation, it remains unused until you launch an instance with matching attributes.
