# CloudWatch Alarm

## Overview

A feature of CloudWatch that watches metrics and goes into an alarm state when certain thresholds or expressions are met.

An alarm can watch a single metric (or multiple metrics) over a specified time period, and performs one or more specified actions, based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over time.

An alarm can send SNS notifications, which can alert via email/messages as well as automatically trigger custom code. Amazon EventBridge events are also sent.

You can add alarms to dashboards.

You can create a billing alarm in CloudWatch.


## Alarm states

An alarm has three possible states.

- **OK**: The metric is within the defined threshold. Everything appears to be operating like normal.
- **ALARM**: The metric is outside of the defined threshold. This could be an operational issue.
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.


## Stop idle EC2 instances

Suppose that your company's developers use Amazon EC2 instances for application development or testing purposes.

If the developers occasionally forget to stop the instances, the instances will continue to run and incur charges. 

In this scenario, you could create a CloudWatch alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain threshold for a specified period.

When configuring the alarm, you can specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.


## Create billing alarms

You can enable monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account.

Estimated charges are calculated and sent to CloudWatch as metric data.

Billing metric data is stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, includes the estimated charges for every used AWS service, in addition to the estimated overall total charges.

The alarm triggers only when the current billing exceeds the threshold you specify. It doesnâ€™t use projections based on your usage so far in the month.

Billing alerts must be enabled before creation of alarm for your estimated charges. It takes about 15 minutes before you can view billing data and set billing alarms.
