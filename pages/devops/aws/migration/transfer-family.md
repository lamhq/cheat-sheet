# AWS Transfer Family

## Overview

AWS Transfer Family lets you transfer data into and out of **S3 and EFS** using 3 protocols:
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
- File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS)

This makes it easy to migrate on-premises data to your AWS infrastructure using common tools such as FileZilla, OpenSSH, and WinSCP.
