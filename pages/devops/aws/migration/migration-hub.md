# AWS Migration Hub

## Overview

AWS Migration Hub gives you a single place to:
- Discover existing servers
- Plan your migration efforts
- Track the progress of your application migration to AWS.

It helps you visualize connection and server/database statuses that are a part of your migrations.

You have the options to start migrations immediately or group servers into application groups first.

Integrates with Server Migration Service (SMS) and Database Migration Service (DMS).


## Migration phases

- **Discover**: Find servers and databases to plan your migrations.
- **Migrate**: Connect tools to Migration Hub, and begin migrating.
- **Track**: Follow migration statuses and progress.


## Tips

You'll be given scenarios that ask you to pick a solution for application migration.

When these come up, DMS is going to be used to move databases.
SMS will be the tool of choice for moving servers. Migration Hub will give you the overview you need.
