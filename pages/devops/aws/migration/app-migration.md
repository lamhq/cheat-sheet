# AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)

## Overview

AWS MGN is a cloud application migration tool that helps you move and improve your on-premises and cloud-based applications to AWS.

It enables companies to lift-and-shift a large number of physical, virtual, or cloud servers to avoid cutover windows or disruptions.

Supports migrating applications from any source infrastructure that runs supported operating systems

MGN replicates source servers into AWS, and automatically converts and launches on AWS to migrate quickly.
