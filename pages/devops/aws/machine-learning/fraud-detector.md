# Amazon Fraud Detector

## Overview

An AWS AI service that is built to **detect fraud in your data**.
Create a fraud detection machine learning model that is based on your data. You can also quickly automate this process.

Useful when you are asked to build a fraud detection machine learning model that is highly customized based on your data.


## Use cases

**Identify Suspicious Online Payments**. Train the model to identify suspicious online payments based on previous cases of fraud.

**Detect New Account Fraud**. Create a model where you can distinguish between genuine new users or accounts and high-risk accounts, and then add additional security checks to the accounts that are high risk.

**Prevent Trial and Loyalty Program Abuse**. Stop users from automating "free trial" accounts so they get indefinite free service.

**Improve Account Takeover Detection**. Automate the detection of account takeovers where an illegitimate user hijacks a legitimate users account.
