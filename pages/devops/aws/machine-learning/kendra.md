# Amazon Kendra

## Overview

Kendra allows you to create an **intelligent search service** powered by machine learning.

Enterprise search applications can bridge between different silos of information (such as S3 buckets, file servers, and websites), allowing your enterprise to have all the data intelligently in one place.


## Use cases

**Accelerate Research and Development**. Previous research papers by scientists may be scattered all over the place, such as in S3 buckets, databases, and text files. With Kendra, you can consolidate this into one place.

**Improve Customer Interactions**. Use Kendra to better understand what your customers are asking, and then return more relevant answers and experiences.

**Minimize Regulatory and Compliance Risks**. You can use machine learning to automate the research of new regulation that may impact your business, such as new ISO requirements, HIPAA, or
PCI-compliant policies.

**Increase Employee Productivity**. By having your data searchable in one place, you can increase your productivity by ensuring your staff are not spending hours trying to find the right data.
