# Amazon Textract

## Overview

Textract uses machine learning to automatically **extract text**, handwriting, and data from scanned documents.

Using machine learning and OCR (optical character recognition), Textract can process text, handwriting, tables, and more with no manual intervention.

You can quickly turn text (such as receipts or handwritten letters) into data, which you can then store in the AWS Cloud in databases or S3.


## Use cases

**Financial Services**. Your customers may fill in a mortgage application by hand. Using Textract, you can convert their handwritten applications into completed forms that are readable by a computer.

**Health Care and Life Sciences**. Most health insurance claims can involve an element of handwriting (e.g., doctors' notes).
Automate this into data you can then quickly process.

**Public Sector**. Tax returns completed by accountants or general members of the public using handwriting can be quickly converted into machine-readable documents.
