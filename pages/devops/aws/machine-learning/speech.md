## Amazon Lex

Chances are that when you are talking to an automated bot online, you are interacting with the Lex service on the backend.

Use cases:

- **Build Virtual Agents and Voice Assistants**. Create virtual agents to arrange refunds, flight changes, password reset requests, and more.
- **Automate Informational Responses**. Automate the frequently asked questions on your website so users can ask them directly.

- **Automate Your Contact Center Transcripts**. Automate your existing contact center scripts as chatbots.


## Amazon Polly

Polly **turns text into lifelike speech** and allows you to create applications that talk to and interact with you using a variety of languages and accents.

Use cases:

- **Content Creation**. Polly allows you to create applications that speak rather than just display text, making your content more accessible. If you visit the AWS blog, you can see an example of Polly converting blog posts into lifelike speech.


## Three services in action

Alexa is powered by three services: Lex, Polly, and Alexa itself. When you speak to your Alexa device, it transcribes your speech into text, which is then sent to the Lex service. The Lex service decides how to respond and sends text back to Polly, which converts the text back to speech.

So, if you use Alexa, you use this service every day without even knowing it. If you don't use Alexa, you probably use Lex an awful lot when you're talking to chatbots online.
