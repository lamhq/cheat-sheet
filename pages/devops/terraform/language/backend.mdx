# Backend Configuration

## Overview

A backend defines where Terraform stores its state data files.

Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the resources it manages.


## Available Backends

[Available built-in backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local) includes:
- [`local`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local): stores state as a local file on disk
- [`remote`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote): store state snapshots and execute operations in Terraform Cloud. You can also only store state in the Terraform Cloud backend.
- [`s3`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3): Stores the state data in a S3 object in a given bucket on Amazon S3
- [`gcs`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs): Stores the state in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- [`http`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/http): Stores the state using a simple REST client.


## Configure a backend

You do not need to configure a backend when using Terraform Cloud because Terraform Cloud automatically manages state in the workspaces associated with your configuration.

To configure a backend, add a nested `backend` block within the top-level `terraform` block.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "example_corp"

    workspaces {
      name = "my-app-prod"
    }
  }
}
```

The block label of the backend block (`"remote"`, in the example above) indicates which backend type to use.

The arguments used in the block's body are specific to the chosen backend type.

If your configuration includes a `cloud` block, it cannot include a `backend` block.

A configuration can only provide one backend block.

A backend block cannot refer to named values.

You cannot reference values declared within backend blocks.


## Initialization

When you change a backend's configuration, you must run `terraform init` again.

Upon initialization, Terraform creates a local `.terraform/` directory. It stores the latest backend configuration and any CLI-provided authentication parameters. **Do not** commit this directory to Git to protect sensitive backend credentials.

The local backend configuration is different and entirely separate from the `terraform.tfstate` file that contains state data about your real-world infrastruture. Terraform stores the `terraform.tfstate` file in your remote backend.

When you **change backends**, Terraform gives you the option to migrate your state to the new backend. Remember to back up  `terraform.tfstate` file before migrating to a new backend.

A configuration file may be specified via the `init` command line:

```sh
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
```

```hcl filename="backend.hcl"
workspaces { name = "workspace" }
hostname = "app.terraform.io"
organization = "company"
```

## Sample configurations

### Local Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "local" {
    path = "relative/path/to/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

### Remote Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "ministry-of-magic"
    workspaces {
      name = "sorting-hat-api-prod"
    }
  }
}
```


### S3

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-bucket-name"
    key            = "path/to/your/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "your-dynamodb-table-name" # For state locking and consistency checks
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
