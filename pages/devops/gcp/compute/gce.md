Compute Engine is a secure and customizable compute service
that lets you create and run virtual machines
on Google's infrastructure.


## Workloads

### General-Purpose

Workloads that simply run a program or application.

### Memory-Optimized 

- SAP workloads
- Electronic design automation
- Workloads that require high-intensive memory

### Compute-Intensive

workloads that require highest performance per core on Compute Engine


### Accelerator-optimized

Workloads that are optimized for compute unified device architecture (CUDA) workloads.


### Scale-out

Work on autopilot to scale out operations or scale out instances or containers
