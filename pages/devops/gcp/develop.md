# Developing within Google Cloud

There are 4 stages of developing in Google Cloud: code, build, artifact, deploy.

## Code

Services:
- **Cloud Code**: set of IDEs that help you integrate your applications with your code. This is where your coding is done.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: a library and command-line tool
that integrates with programming languages that helps you interact with all resources from the command line

## Build

- Cloud Source Repositories: a private version control Git repo
that allows you to store your code and collaborate around the world
- Cloud Build: a code integration tool that is set to test and run builds through serverless containers


## Artifact

- Artifact Registry: a single place for your container images and packages


## Deploy

- Cloud Run: deploys serverless containerized applications
- GKE: Google's deployment and management service for Kubernetes
- Deployment Manager: infrastructure as Code deployment service
