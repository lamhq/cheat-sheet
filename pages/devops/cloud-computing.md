# Cloud computing

## Overview

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Deployment Models for Cloud Computing

When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as:
- required cloud application components.
- preferred resource management tools.
- any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

### Cloud-based Deployment

In a cloud-based deployment model, you can:
- migrate existing applications to the cloud,
- design and build new applications in the cloud
- build applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Or build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

> For example, a company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud.

### On-premises Deployment

On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

> For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.

### Hybrid Deployment

In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.

> For example, suppose that a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.


## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### Trade upfront expense for variable expense

Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them.

Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them.

### Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers.

A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.

### Stop guessing capacity

With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.

> For example, you can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time you use.

### Benefit from massive economies of scale

By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale.

The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices. 

### Increase speed and agility

The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications.

Cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.

### Go global in minutes

AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.

Even if you are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays.
