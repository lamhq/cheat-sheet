# pytest Fixtures

## Overview

Fixtures are functions that are run by pytest before/after the actual test functions.

You can use fixtures to:
- get a data set for the tests to work on
- get a system into a known state before running a test
- get data ready for multiple tests

An exception happens during a fixture is reported as "Error".

Here's a simple fixture that returns a number:
```py
import pytest
@pytest.fixture()
def some_data():
    """Return answer to ultimate question."""
    return 42

def test_some_data(some_data):
    """Use fixture return value in a test."""
    assert some_data == 42
```


## Fixture scopes

Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their `scope`:

- `function`: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
- `module`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
- `package`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package, or test directory.
- `class`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
- `session`: Run once per session. All test methods and functions using a fixture of session scope share one setup and teardown call.

The scope is set at the definition of a fixture, and not at the place where it's called. 

```py
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def cards_db():
    with TemporaryDirectory() as db_dir: db_path = Path(db_dir)
        db = cards.CardsDB(db_path)
        yield db
        db.close()
```


## Sharing Fixtures

You can put fixtures into a `conftest.py` file, and share fixtures among multiple test files.

The `conftest.py` file must be either in the same directory as the test file or in some parent directory.

```py filename="path/conftest.py"
@pytest.fixture()
def cards_db():
    with TemporaryDirectory() as db_dir:
        db_path = Path(db_dir)
        db = cards.CardsDB(db_path)
        yield db
        # teardown part, run after test code
        db.close()
```

```py filename="path/test_count.py"
import cards

def test_empty(cards_db):
    assert cards_db.count() == 0

def test_two(cards_db):
    cards_db.add_card(cards.Card("first"))
    cards_db.add_card(cards.Card("second"))
    assert cards_db.count() == 2    
```


## Fixtures dependency

Fixtures can only depend on other fixtures of their same scope or wider.

For example, a function-scope fixture can depend on other function-scope fixtures, class-, module-, and session-scope fixtures, but you can't go in the reverse order.


## Listing Fixtures

Below command list available fixtures in a directory or test file:
```sh
pytest --fixtures -v path/to/directory
```

You can also use `--fixtures-per-test` to see what fixtures are used by each test and where the fixtures are defined:
```sh
pytest --fixtures-per-test test_count.py::test_empty
```


## Multi Level Fixtures

```py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def first_number():
    """Get the first value"""
    return 10

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def second_number(first_number):
    """Get the second value"""
    return first_number * 3

def test_value(second_number):
    assert second_number == 30
```


## Using Multiple Fixtures per Test

```py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def first_number():
    """Get the first value"""
    return 10

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def second_number():
    """Get the second value"""
    return 30

def test_value(first_number, second_number):
    value = first_number + second_number
    assert value == 40
```


## Always run fixtures

You can use `autouse=True` to get a fixture to run all of the time. This works well for code you want to run at certain times, but tests donâ€™t really depend on any system state or data from the fixture.

```py filename="test_autouse.py"
import pytest
import time

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def footer_function_scope():
    """Report test durations after each function."""
    start = time.time()
    yield
    stop = time.time()
    delta = stop - start
    print("\ntest duration : {:0.3} seconds".format(delta))

def test_1():
    """Simulate long-ish running test."""
    time.sleep(1)
```

Run the test with turning off output capture:
```sh
pytest -v --capture=no test_autouse.py
```

Output:
```
===================== test session starts ======================
collected 1 item

test/test_demo.py::test_1 PASSED
test duration : 1.01 seconds
=================== 1 passed in 1.01 seconds ===================
```

Without turning off output capture, pytest only prints the output of tests that fail.


## Monkey patch

The `monkeypatch` fixture is a powerful tool that helps you safely modify behavior during tests.

It allows you to set or delete attributes, dictionary items, environment variables, or even modify `sys.path` for importing. 

Some methods provided by the `monkeypatch` fixture:

1. **`monkeypatch.setattr(obj, name, value, raising=True)`**: patch an attribute or property of an object with your desired testing behavior.

2. **`monkeypatch.delattr(obj, name, raising=True)`**: Remove an attribute or property from an object for testing purposes.

3. **`monkeypatch.setitem(mapping, name, value)`**: Patch a dictionary item for the test. Useful for modifying global configurations or other dictionaries.

4. **`monkeypatch.delitem(obj, name, raising=True)`**: Remove an item from a dictionary.

5. **`monkeypatch.setenv(name, value, prepend=None)`**: Modify environment variables for a test. Useful for testing program behavior when an environment variable is missing or setting multiple values for a known variable.

6. **`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(path)`**: Modify `sys.path`.

7. **`monkeypatch.chdir(path)`**: Change the current working directory during a test.

8. **`monkeypatch.context()`**: Apply patches only in a specific scope, which can help control teardown of complex fixtures or patches to the standard library.


Here's how we modify the behavior of the `Path.home` function to return `/abc`:

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

def get_user_directory():
    # Some logic to determine user directory
    return Path.home()

def test_user_directory(monkeypatch):
    # Patch Path.home() to always return a specific path
    monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", lambda: Path("/abc"))

    # Now, get_user_directory() will always return Path("/abc")
    assert get_user_directory() == Path("/abc")
```

All modifications made using `monkeypatch` are undone after the test function or fixture finishes.
