# Writing Test

## File name

Naming conventions to keep your test code discoverable by pytest:
- Test files should be named `test_<something>.py` or `<something>_test.py`.
- Test methods and functions should be named `test_<something>`.
- Test classes should be named `Test<Something>`.


## Organize test files

Here we define how to structure test files in the project source code.

Test files should be in a separate `tests/` folder (instead of sitting next to the code file):

```
module/
    __init__.py
    module.py
    another_module.py
tests/
    test_module.py
    test_another_module.py
```

**Advantages**:
- This separation keeps your codebase cleaner and avoids cluttering the main code directory with test files.
- Clean codebase helps locate code file easier
- Isolated Work: allows individuals to concentrate on writing tests without interfering with others' code files.

**Disadvantages**:
- It's not easy to find and import code files.
- You can not use relative imports in test files to import code files.


## Assertion Helper

When an `assert` statement fails, it will make a test fail.

In rare cases where `assert` is not suitable, use `pytest.fail()`:

```py showLineNumbers {7}
from cards import Card
import pytest

def assert_identical(c1: Card, c2: Card):
    __tracebackhide__ = True
    if c1.id != c2.id:
        pytest.fail(f"id's don't match. {c1.id} != {c2.id}")


def test_identical():
    c1 = Card("foo", id=123)
    c2 = Card("foo", id=123)
    assert_identical(c1, c2)


def test_identical_fail():
    c1 = Card("foo", id=123)
    c2 = Card("foo", id=456)
    assert_identical(c1, c2)
```

We can also use `assert c1.id == c2.id, "id's don't match."` with the same effect.

In above example, `assert_identical` is an assertion helper function, which is used to wrap up a complicated assertion check. With `__tracebackhide__ = True`, failing tests will not include content of assertion helper function in the traceback.


## Testing for Exceptions

You use `pytest.raises()` to test if a bit of code you are testing is supposed to raise an exception:
```py
import pytest
import cards

def test_no_path_raises():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        # it should raise an exception since
        # the method expected an argument
        cards.CardsDB()
```

Check the exception's message is correct:
```py
def test_raises_with_info():
    match_regex = "missing 1 .* positional argument"
    # The match parameter takes a regular expression
    # and matches it with the exception message.
    with pytest.raises(TypeError, match=match_regex):
        cards.CardsDB()

def test_raises_with_info_alt():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as exc_info:
        cards.CardsDB()
        expected = "missing 1 required positional argument"
        assert expected in str(exc_info.value)
```


## Test Functions

Best practices:
- A test should not focusing on testing one behavior
- Keep assertions at the end of test functions
- Separate a test into stages (Given-When-Then or Arrange-Act-Assert):
    - getting ready to do something
    - doing something
    - checking to see if it worked

```py
def test_to_dict():
    # GIVEN a Card object with known contents
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)

    # WHEN we call to_dict() on the object
    c2 = c1.to_dict()

    # THEN the result will be a dictionary with known content
    c2_expected = {
        "summary": "something",
        "owner": "brian",
        "state": "todo",
        "id": 123,
    }
    assert c2 == c2_expected
```

Anti-pattern: perform a lots of actions, followed by state or behavior checks. This makes tests hard to debug and maintain because later developers have no idea what the original intent of the test was.


## Test class

Pytest allows us to group tests with classes.

The application code to test:
```py
@dataclass
class Card:
    summary: str = None
    owner: str = None
    state: str = "todo"
    id: int = field(default=None, compare=False)

@classmethod
def from_dict(cls, d):
    return Card(**d)

def to_dict(self):
    return asdict(self)
```

Test files for the class:
```py filename="test_card.py"
from cards import Card


def test_field_access():
    c = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    assert c.summary == "something"
    assert c.owner == "brian"
    assert c.state == "todo"
    assert c.id == 123


def test_defaults():
    c = Card()
    assert c.summary is None
    assert c.owner is None
    assert c.state == "todo"
    assert c.id is None


def test_equality():
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    c2 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    assert c1 == c2


def test_equality_with_diff_ids():
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    c2 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 4567)
    assert c1 == c2

def test_inequality():
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    c2 = Card("completely different", "okken", "done", 123)
    assert c1 != c2


def test_from_dict():
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    c2_dict = {
        "summary": "something",
        "owner": "brian",
        "state": "todo",
        "id": 123,
    }
    c2 = Card.from_dict(c2_dict)
    assert c1 == c2


def test_to_dict():
    c1 = Card("something", "brian", "todo", 123)
    c2 = c1.to_dict()
    c2_expected = {
        "summary": "something",
        "owner": "brian",
        "state": "todo",
        "id": 123,
    }
    assert c2 == c2_expected
```
