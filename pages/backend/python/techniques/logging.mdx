# Logging

## Overview

The `logging` module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.


## Getting started

You can access logging functionality by creating a logger by calling `logging.getLogger(__name__)` then calling the logger's methods.

```py
import logging

# get the logger for the current module
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# create a logging handler and attach it to logger
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# perform logging
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("critical message: %s", "error message")
```


## Logging Handlers

**Logging handlers** are responsible for dispatching log messages to specific destinations.

### StreamHandler

This class sends logging output to streams such as `sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`, or any file-like object.

It's useful for displaying logs in the console.

You can create an instance like this:
```python
import logging

console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()

logger.addHandler(console_handler)
```

### FileHandler

The `FileHandler` class sends logging output to a disk file.

It inherits functionality from `StreamHandler`.

You can create an instance like this:
```python
import logging

file_handler = logging.FileHandler("filename.log")

logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```


## Logging Levels

There're several log levels, each associated with a specific severity.

Here are the standard log levels, in increasing order of severity:
1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
2. **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
3. **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., disk space low). The software is still working as expected.
4. **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
5. **CRITICAL**: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

By default, the logging level is set to `WARNING`, meaning that only `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages will be logged unless you change the level.

You can set the log level of the root logger like this:
```python
# show logs of all levels
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

To set the log level for a logger, you'll need to attach a log handler first, then call the `setLevel()` method before any logging operations:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# create a logging handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# set log level, only INFO -> CRITICAL are shown
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```


You can change the log level of a module from outside. Suppose we have the following file structure:
```
.
├── code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── lib.py
└── main.py
```

```py filename="code/lib.py"
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def do_sth():
    logger.debug("This is a debug message")
    logger.info("This is an info message")
    logger.warning("This is a warning message")
    logger.error("This is an error message")
    logger.critical("critical message: %s", "error message")
```

You can change the log level of the module `code/lib.py` in `main.py` to only display error and critial logs, like this:
```py filename="main.py"
import logging
from code.lib import do_sth

logger = logging.getLogger('code.lib')
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)

do_sth()
```


## Log format

```py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s :: %(levelname)s :: %(message)s'
)
logging.info("Just like that!")
# 2019-02-17 11:40:38,254 :: INFO :: Just like that!
```


## Include traceback info

Include traceback information in logged messages.

```py
import logging

# Create or get the logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# set log level
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def divide(x, y):
    try:
        out = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logger.exception("Division by zero problem")
    else:
        return out

# Logs
logger.error("Divide {x} / {y} = {c}".format(x=10, y=0, c=divide(10,0)))

#> ERROR:__main__:Division by zero problem
#> Traceback (most recent call last):
#>   File "<ipython-input-16-a010a44fdc0a>", line 12, in divide
#>     out = x / y
#> ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
#> ERROR:__main__:None
```
