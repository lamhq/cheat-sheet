# Generalization (Inheritance)

## Overview

Generalization is a mechanism for combining similar classes of objects into a single, more general class.

Generalization identifies commonalities among a set of entities.

A superclass has the most general attributes, operations, and relationships that may be shared with subclasses. A subclass may have more specialized attributes and operations.

The relationship is displayed as a solid line with a hollow arrowhead that points from the child element to the parent element.
