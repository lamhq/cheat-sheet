# Realization (Specialization)

## Overview

Realization is a relationship between the blueprint class and the object containing its respective implementation level details.

This object is said to realize the blueprint class.

Can be understand as the relationship between the interface and the implementing class.

For example, the `Owner` interface specify methods `acquire` and `dispose` of property. The `Person` and `Corporation` classes need to implement these methods, possibly in very different ways.
