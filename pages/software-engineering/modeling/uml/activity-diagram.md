# Activity diagram

## Overview

The Unified Modeling Language includes several subsets of diagrams, including structure diagrams, interaction diagrams, and behavior diagrams.

Behavior diagrams describe what must happen in the system being modeled.

Activity diagrams are considered behavior diagrams.


## Use cases

- Demonstrate the logic of an algorithm.
- Describe the steps performed in a UML use case.
- Illustrate a business process, workflow, and software behavior
- Model software architecture elements, such as method, function, and operation.


## Benefits

Help stakeholders from both business and development sides understand the same process.


## Components

### Action

A step in the activity wherein the users or software perform a given task. In Lucidchart, actions are symbolized with round-edged rectangles.

### Decision node

A conditional branch in the flow that is represented by a diamond. It includes a single input and two or more outputs.

Condition text. Placed next to a decision marker to let you know under what condition an activity flow should split off in that direction:

### Control flows

Another name for the connectors that show the flow between steps in the diagram.

An incoming arrow starts a step of an activity:

Combines two concurrent activities and re-introduces them to a flow where only one activity occurs at a time:

Splits a single activity flow into two concurrent activities:

### Start node

Symbolizes the beginning of the activity:

### End node

Represents the final step in the activity:

### Note

Allows the diagram creators or collaborators to communicate additional messages that don't fit within the diagram itself.

### End flow

Represents the end of a specific process flow.

The flow final symbol should be placed at the end of a process in a single activity flow.

### Loop

Allows the creator to model a repetitive sequence within the option loop symbol.

## Examples

### Login page

This activity diagram shows the process of logging into a website, from entering a username and password to successfully logging in to the system.

### Banking system

This diagram shows the process of either withdrawing money from or depositing money into a bank account.
