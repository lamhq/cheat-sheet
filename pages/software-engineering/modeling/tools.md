# Diagram as Code Tools

## Benefits

Representing diagrams as code allows tracking of diagram changes in version control systems.

This "diagram as code" approach bridges documentation with system implementation.

## Tools

Tools that convert code into architecture diagrams:

### Diagrams

A Python library that lets you draw cloud system architectures in code.

**Diagrams** supports visualizing infrastructure across major providers and stacks: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.


### Go-Diagrams

It let's you write diagrams in Go.


### Mermaid

A JavaScript library that enables creating diagrams 
and visualizations using text.

Mermaid aims to solve "doc-rot" where diagramming and docs take precious developer time yet still get outdated quickly.

Enables even non-programmers to create detailed visuals through the **Mermaid Live Editor**.


### PlantUML

Offers a domain-specific language to generate many diagram types: sequence diagrams, architectural diagrams, network topology, Gantt charts, and even ASCII art.

Broad features, powerful option for embedding diagrams alongside code.

Has a bit more learning curve compared to other tools.


### ASCII Editors

Allow you to draw diagrams visually or in text and then render them as ASCII art.

ASCII editors let you easily author text-based diagrams, layouts, flow charts, ...

These diagrams can embed anywhere.


### Markmap

Markmap creates and visualizes mind maps derived from Markdown documents.

It supports various platforms but may not 
work well on very large or complex mind maps.
