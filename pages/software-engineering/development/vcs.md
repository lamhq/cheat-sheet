# Version Control Systems

## Overview

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help software teams manage changes to source code.

They keep track of every modification, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.

Version control is essential for efficient and effective software development, especially when working in teams.

It ensures that the codebase remains stable and that changes are well-documented and reversible.


## Types of VCS

1. **Local Version Control**: Changes are stored locally on the developer's machine.
2. **Centralized Version Control**: A single server stores all versions of the code, and developers check out files from this central place.
3. **Distributed Version Control**: Each developer has a local copy of the entire codebase, including its history. Git is a popular example of this type.


## Benefits

- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Backup and Restore**: Previous versions of the code can be restored if something goes wrong.
- **Branching and Merging**: Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently, and later merge them into the main codebase.
- **Tracking Changes**: Every change is documented, making it easier to understand the evolution of the codebase.

## Popular VCS
- **Git**: Widely used, especially in open-source projects. It supports distributed version control.
- **Mercurial**: Another distributed version control system, similar to Git.
- **Subversion (SVN)**: A centralized version control system.

## Best Practices
- **Commit Often**: Regular commits help track progress and make it easier to identify issues.
- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Clear messages help others understand the purpose of changes.
- **Use Branches**: Isolate new features or bug fixes to avoid disrupting the main codebase.
- **Review Code**: Peer reviews help maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.
