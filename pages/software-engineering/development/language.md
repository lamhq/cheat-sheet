# Programming Languages

## Compiled languages

- The source code is translated into machine code (executable code) by a compiler before execution.
- Compilation involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, optimization, and code generation.
- The compiled program can be directly executed by the computer's processor.

Benefits: faster execution speed and better performance.

Examples: C, Rust, Golang


## Interpreted languages

- The source code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime.
- The interpreter reads each line, translates it into machine instructions, and executes it immediately.
- There is no compilation step, the source code remains in its original form.

Benefits:
- Portability: the same code can run on different platforms without modification
- Dynamic typing and runtime introspection.

Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby
