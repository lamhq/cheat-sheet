# Design Patterns

## Overview

Design patterns are ways of constructing object-oriented systems that are maintainable, reusable, and flexible (can cope with change).

A pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.

Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.

You can follow a pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

Patterns aren't invented, they are discovered.


## Why Should I Learn Patterns?

*Knowing the OO basics (abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) does not make good OO designs. Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.*

Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.

By knowing patterns, you can skip the hard work of figuring out solutions to common problems in software design and jump straight to designs that always work.

Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently.


## Classification of patterns

Patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.

Three main groups of patterns:
- **Creational pattern**s provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.


## Tips

The best way to use patterns is to:
1. Load your brain with them (learn all of them)
2. Recognize places where you can apply them (in your designs and existing applications)

When you can't find a pattern that matches your problem, there are some object-oriented principles underlie the patterns will help you to cope.

One of the secrets to creating maintainable OO systems is thinking about how they might change in the future, object-oriented principles can address those issues.
