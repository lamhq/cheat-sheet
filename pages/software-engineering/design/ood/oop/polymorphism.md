# Polymorphism

## Overview

Polymorphism refers to the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.

You can also think of polymorphism as the ability of an object to “pretend” to be something else, usually a class it extends or an interface it implements.


## Benefits

### Improved Code Flexibility
- Polymorphism enables code to adapt to different situations and object types.
- You can write generic algorithms that operate on a wide range of objects without knowing their specific types.
- This flexibility simplifies system design and accommodates future changes.


### Enhanced Code Extensibility
- Polymorphism supports extensibility by allowing you to add new classes or behaviors without altering existing code.
- You can introduce new subclasses or override methods in derived classes.
- This extensibility is essential for evolving software over time.


### Improved Code Maintainability
- When you add new classes or modify existing ones, polymorphism ensures that existing code remains compatible.
- Changes to a base class or interface ripple through all related classes, reducing the risk of breaking existing functionality.
- This maintainability is crucial for large-scale projects.


### Enhanced Code Readability
- Polymorphism promotes a clear and consistent interface for interacting with objects.
- When you encounter a method call, you don't need to worry about the specific class—just focus on the common interface.
- This readability makes code easier to understand and maintain.
