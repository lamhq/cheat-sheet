# Design Principles

## Overview

What defines good software design, how to measure it, and which practices to follow vary by application type.

There are several universal principles that guide the creation of robust, maintainable, and scalable software.

Most of the design patterns are based on these principles.


## SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

Using these principles mindlessly can cause more harm than good. Applying them blindly might overcomplicate a program's architecture.

While striving for these principles is beneficial, always be pragmatic and don't treat them as dogma.
