# Object-oriented programming

## Overview

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm.

It's based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, into special bundles called **objects**.

Objects are constructed from a set of "blueprints", called **classes**, defined by a programmer.


## Pillars of OOP

Object-oriented programming is based on four pillars (concepts) that differentiate it from other programming paradigms:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
