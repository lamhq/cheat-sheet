# Software Modeling

## Overview

**Software modeling** involves creating abstract representations of the most significant aspects of the software. 

It's a crucial step in software development, allowing designers and developers to visualize and analyze a system before actual coding begins.

Modeling is the process of designing software applications before writing code.

In model-based software design, models are built and analyzed to guide subsequent implementation. These models can include various perspectives, such as requirements, static structures, and dynamic behavior, and are often expressed using graphical languages like UML (Unified Modeling Language).
