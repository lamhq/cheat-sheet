# Planning

## Focusing on Outcomes

The reason that makes you feel busy but not getting much done and not getting closer to your goals is **missing understanding of WHY you're doing the task**.

A completed task is not the outcome.

Ask your self:
- "What's OUTCOME you're hoping to achieve?"
- "What do you really want?"

**The goals you set must capture the OUTCOMES you want.**

**The tasks are the strategies you make to achieve your goals.**

> For example, a saleperson made a goal: "i'm going to make 4 phone calls a day in this week".
>
> He may not actually achieve what he really wanted: "make 2 sales for the week".
> 
> The phone calls is the strategy, not the goal.


## Creating a Todo List

1. Determine **WHERE** you'll put your todo list. It need to be visible and easily accessible.
   - white board
   - wall in your room
   - in a task app in phone and computer
2. Choose a time that you will plan the coming week's tasks (20-30 minutes)
   - *i will create my weekly plan every Monday at 7pm*

### Week plan
1. List all the tasks/activities you'll need to do this week
2. [Identify task's priority](#prioritization): hight, medium, low
3. Plan to do the high priority first
4. Schedule tasks that are time-framed
5. Assign other tasks to specific days of the week

### Day plan
1. Plan your day **the day before**
2. Schedule in appointments, time-framed tasks
3. Look at your week plan and outcome for the week
4. For each task, remind yourself the outcome from the accompishment of **the task and the bigger-picture goal**
5. Choose 3-5 tasks that will make you feel like it was a successful day when accomplished
6. Do MUST and time-sensitive tasks **first**
7. Pick just 1 to focus and give it 100% attention
8. When new needs arise, if they're not higher priority than your current focused tasks, add them to your weekly list and do NOT work on them today


## The 80/20 Rule

**In any field of endeavor, 80% of results come from 20% of actions.**

Ask yourself the following questions:
1. What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?
2. What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?

Ask those questions related to a variety of areas, such as:
- Your customers/clients
- Your business partners/vendors
- Your employees
- Your relationship(s)
- Your strategies
- Your tasks


## Prioritization

Assess whether goals/tasks have higher priority than other tasks base on:
- **URGENT**: tasks that require immediate attention, time-sensitive, often driven by deadlines or external pressures.
- **IMPORTANT**: tasks that contribute significantly to long-term goals and values.

Look at your priority list and determine which ones will provide more **value**.

**Rank each task** in order of the amount of effort (or time) they will take to complete:
- Simpler Tasks First:
  - Quick completion.
  - See progress faster.
  - Increased motivation.
- Most Challenging Task First:
  - Stimulates your brain.
  - Builds momentum.
- Be honest with yourself if something is beyond your capabilities of completing and if it is keeping you away from other important tasks.
  > If it is a big project that takes 10 hours, don’t tell yourself you have to do it in 3.


## Be Flexible

Priorities can change. Sometimes something gets dropped on your lap and you have to abandon your plan.

Before changing, STOP first and ask yourself: *if this "emergency" truly is more urgent and valuable than the other priority I’ve already determined is my top pick?*


## Eliminating Time Wasters

Remove activities that have no clear purpose or NOT truly aligned with your goals


## Avoiding perfectionism

Set time limits on the areas (that you tend to over-perfect) to make sure you have time left for other important things.
