# Cypress Component Testing

Cypress Component Testing provides a component workbench for you to quickly build and test components from multiple front-end UI libraries.


## Why Cypress Component Testing?

Cypress Test Runner is browser-based, allowing you to test not only your component's functionality but also styles and appearance. You can visually see your component in action and interact with it in the test runner.


## Component Testing vs. End-to-End Testing

Cypress Component Testing uses the same test runner, commands, and API to test components instead of pages.

Cypress Component Testing builds your components using a development server instead of rendering within a complete website, which results in faster tests and fewer dependencies on infrastructure than end-to-end tests covering the same code paths.
