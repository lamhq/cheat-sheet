# Overview

## Why Cypress?

Cypress is a front end testing tool built for the modern web. This enables you to **write faster**, **easier** and **more reliable** tests.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Component tests
- Integration tests
- Unit tests

Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.


## Features

- Time Travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run
- Debuggability: readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.
- Automatic Waiting: Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on.
- Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers.
- Network Traffic Control: stub, and test edge cases without involving your server.
- Consistent Results: consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.
- Screenshots and Videos: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI. 
- Cross Browser Testing
- Smart Orchestration: easily parallelize your test suite, rerun failed specs.
- Flake Detection: Discover and diagnose unreliable tests

> What is a flaky test?
A test is considered to be flaky when it can pass and fail across multiple retry attempts without any code changes.
## Example

The Cypress team has created the [Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app), a full stack example application that demonstrates testing with Cypress in practical and realistic scenarios.
