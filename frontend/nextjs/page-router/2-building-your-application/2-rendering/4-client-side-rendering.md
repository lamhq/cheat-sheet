# Client-side Rendering (CSR)

In Client-Side Rendering (CSR) with React, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and the JavaScript needed for the page. The JavaScript is then used to update the DOM and render the page. 

When the application is first loaded, the user may notice a slight delay before they can see the full page, this is because the page isn't fully rendered until all the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.

This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant and the page doesnâ€™t need to be pre-rendered. The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching.

In Next.js, there are two ways you can implement client-side rendering:

1. Using React's `useEffect()` hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods ([`getStaticProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)).
2. Using a data fetching library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) to fetch data on the client (recommended).

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export function Page() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
      }
      const result = await response.json()
      setData(result)
    }

    fetchData().catch((e) => {
      // handle the error as needed
      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)
    })
  }, [])

  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>
}
```
