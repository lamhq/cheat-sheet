# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site.

To use ISR, add the `revalidate` prop to `getStaticProps`:

```jsx
function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if
// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every 10 seconds
    revalidate: 10, // In seconds
  }
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if
// the path has not been generated.
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }))

  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
  // { fallback: 'blocking' } will server-render pages
  // on-demand if the path doesn't exist.
  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }
}

export default Blog
```

When a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.

- Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.
- After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page
- Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.
- Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.

When a request is made to a path that hasnâ€™t been generated, Next.js will server-render the page on the first request. Future requests will serve the static file from the cache. ISR on Vercel [persists the cache globally and handles rollbacks](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).


## On-Demand Revalidation

If you set a `revalidate` time, the only way to invalidate the cache is from someone visiting that page after the timeout has passed.

If `revalidate` is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of `false` (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when `revalidate()` is called.

### Using On-Demand Revalidation

create the revalidation API Route:

```js filename="pages/api/revalidate.js"
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // this should be the actual path not a rewritten path
    // e.g. for "/blog/[slug]" this should be "/blog/post-1"
    await res.revalidate('/path-to-revalidate')
    return res.json({ revalidated: true })
  } catch (err) {
    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue
    // to show the last successfully generated page
    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating')
  }
}
```


### Testing on-Demand ISR during development

When running locally with `next dev`, `getStaticProps` is invoked on every request. To verify your on-demand ISR configuration is correct, you will need to create a production build and start the production server:

```bash filename="Terminal"
$ next build
$ next start
```
