# Authenticating

## Authentication Patterns

There are two main patterns:

- Use static generation to server-render a loading state, followed by fetching user data client-side.
- Fetch user data server-side to eliminate a flash of unauthenticated content.

### Statically Generated Pages

Your page can render a loading state from the server, followed by fetching the user client-side.

One advantage of this pattern is it allows pages to be served from a global CDN and preloaded using `next/link`. In practice, this results in a faster TTI (Time to Interactive).

Let's look at an example for a profile page. This will initially render a loading skeleton. Once the request for a user has finished, it will show the user's name:

```jsx filename="pages/profile.js"
import useUser from '../lib/useUser'
import Layout from '../components/Layout'

const Profile = () => {
  // Fetch the user client-side
  const { user } = useUser({ redirectTo: '/login' })

  // Server-render loading state
  if (!user || user.isLoggedIn === false) {
    return <Layout>Loading...</Layout>
  }

  // Once the user request finishes, show the user
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Your Profile</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}</pre>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Profile
```


### Server-Rendered Pages

If you export an `async` function called `getServerSideProps` from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`.

Let's transform the profile example to use [server-side rendering](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering). If there's a session, return `user` as a prop to the `Profile` component in the page. Notice there is not a loading skeleton in [this example](https://iron-session-example.vercel.app/).


```jsx filename="pages/profile.js"
import withSession from '../lib/session'
import Layout from '../components/Layout'

export const getServerSideProps = withSession(async function ({ req, res }) {
  const { user } = req.session

  if (!user) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  return {
    props: { user },
  }
})

const Profile = ({ user }) => {
  // Show the user. No loading state is required
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Your Profile</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}</pre>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default Profile
```

It's important to note fetching user data in `getServerSideProps` will block rendering until the request to your authentication provider resolves. To prevent creating a bottleneck and increasing your TTFB (Time to First Byte), you should ensure your authentication lookup is fast.

An advantage of this pattern is preventing a flash of unauthenticated content before redirecting.


## Authentication Providers

- [with-iron-session](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-iron-session): low-level, encrypted, and stateless session utility
- [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example): full-featured authentication system with built-in providers (Google, Facebook, GitHubâ€¦), JWT, JWE, email/password, magic links and more.
