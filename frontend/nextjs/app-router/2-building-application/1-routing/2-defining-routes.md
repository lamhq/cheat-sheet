# Defining Routes

## Creating Routes

Next.js uses a file-system based router where **folders** are used to define routes.

Each folder represents a **route** segment that maps to a **URL** segment. To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other.

A special `page.js` file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.
