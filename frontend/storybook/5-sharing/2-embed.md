# Embed stories

Embed stories to showcase your work to teammates and the developer community.

Storybook supports `<iframe>` embeds out of the box.

If you use Chromatic to publish Storybook, you can also embed stories in Notion, Medium, and countless other platforms that support the oEmbed standard.
