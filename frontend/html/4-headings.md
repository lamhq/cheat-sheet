# Headings

- There are six section heading elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`.
- When a heading is nested in a document banner `<header>`, it is the heading for the application or site.
- When nested in `<main>`, it is the header for that page, not the whole site.
- When nested in an `<article>` or `<section>`, it is the header for that subsection of the page.
