## What is Web Accessibility and Why Does It Matter?

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed in a way so that people with disabilities can both use them and contribute to the Web. 

When software is correctly written for the Web, the Web removes the barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world.

It is important to remember that all of us are just an accident or a few years of age away from needing to use assistive technology, so it is in all of our best interest to strive towards creating an inclusive infrastructure for our ever increasingly digital lives.


## Types of Disabilities

Web Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- **Motor** (Mobility impairments): Partial or total loss of the function of a body part.
- **Visual** (Visual impairments): Partial or total loss of vision.
- **Auditory** (Hearing impairments): Partial or total loss of hearing.
- **Cognitive** (Cognitive impairments): One who has a greater difficulty with one or more types of mental tasks than the average person.
- **Neurological**: One who experiences seizures or vestibular issues when exposed to certain images and animations.
- **Situational**: Certain situations where one becomes temporarily disabled. Examples include parents holding a new born while trying to operate a computer, reading text on a phone in direct sunlight, and watching Netflix in class or during a meeting.


### Visual impairments

Tools include: 
- Screen reader software
- screen magnification tools
- Braille output devices.

Pain points:
- Digital products that do not work with screen reader software
- mobile websites/apps without pinch to zoom
- complex graphs and charts differentiated by colors alone
- color contrasts that make it difficult to read text on the screen


### Mobility impairments

Tools include: 
- Adaptive switches
- eye tracking devices
- mouth/head sticks
- speech input.

Pain points:
- Elements that are only designed to work with the use of a mouse.


### Hearing impairments

Tools include:
- hearing aids
- captions, transcripts
- sign language.

Pain points:
- Audio content without text transcripts
- video with no synchronized captions


### Cognitive impairments

Tools include:
- Screen readers
- text highlighting
- text prediction
- abstractive summarization tools.

Pain points:
- Busy interfaces that make it overly complicated to focus on the task at hand
- Big walls of words with little whitespace, justified text
- Small or hard-to-read fonts.


### Speech impairments

A speech disorder is a condition in which a person has problems creating or forming the speech sounds needed to communicate with others.

Tools include:
- Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) 
- speech-generating devices.

Pain points:
- Voice-activated technology such as smart home devices and apps.


## Assistive Technologies

People with disabilities use technology in a variety of ways. Here are some examples:

- People with hand tremors cannot grip a mouse. They use the **keyboard** to navigate.
- People with mobility disabilities use their **voice** to control the computer or mobile device.
- People with mobility disabilities use **eye tracking** to move the screen cursor.
- People with mobility disabilities use **switch devices** to operate the computer or mobile device.
- People who are blind use **screen readers, braille displays** or **speech recognition** software.
- People with low vision use screen magnification.


## How Web Accessibility is Evaluated?

Each country has different accessibility requirements for companies, and government organizations, however, many have adopted the same criteria that the W3C has created.

This standard is called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

### WCAG

WCAG is a document that explains how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities.

There are 3 levels of conformance within the WCAG: A, AA, AAA. 

Single A criteria is the bare minimum needed for a disabled user to be able to use a website while AAA conformance also encompasses all A, AA, and AAA criteria and is the most inclusive standard to strive for. However, in many cases, AAA conformance is impractical or impossible to reach. Therefore, most governments and organization strive to conform to the WCAG AA standard.

WCAG's core concepts boil down to making web content P.O.U.R.. 


### P.O.U.R

P.O.U.R. stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. 

- **Perceivable**: Users are able to perceive the content through their senses via the browser or other assistive technology.
- **Operable**:  Users can interact with all controls and interactive elements using either the mouse, keyboard, or an assistive device.
- **Understandable**: Content is clear and limits confusion and ambiguity.
- **Robust**: A wide range of technologies and devices can access the content.
