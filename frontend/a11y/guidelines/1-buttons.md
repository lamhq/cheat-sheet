# Accessibility Buttons & Links

Buttons and links are specific types of interactive components. Each of them work differently with assistive technologies. The correct use of each component helps users with assistive technologies to interact with the component.

The `<button>` element should be used for any interaction that performs **an action on the current page**.

The `<a>` element should be used for any interaction that **navigates to another view**.
