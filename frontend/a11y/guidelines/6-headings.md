# Headings

A heading is text that describes the content that follows it.

Screen reader users use headings to navigate and scan the page.

The headings must be clear, both visually and use clear wording. The heading structure of a page forms the outline of the page.

It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections. `<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.
