# Uniform Distribution

## Probability Distribution

A **probability distribution** specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable

A **random variable** is a quantity whose future outcome is uncertain. Ex: stock price

A **discrete** random variable can take on only a defined number of possible values. Ex: stock prices that are valued in dollars and cents

A **continuous** random variable can take on any value. Ex: stock returns.


## Discrete Uniform Distribution

For example, rolling a dice has a discrete uniform distribution.

It is **discrete** as the outcome has to take on a particular value, and it is **uniform** as each outcome is equally likely.
