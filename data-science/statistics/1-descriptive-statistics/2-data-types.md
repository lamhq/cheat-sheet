# Types of Data

## Data

Data is a collection of:
- numbers, characters (eg. Financial statements)
- words/text (EG. Analysis reports or social media),
- images (maybe from satellites),
- audio collected by your smart speakers,
- video collected by your smart doorbells.

We can clasify data in two main ways:
- Base on its types: types of data
- Measument levels

## Types of data

### Categorical

- Nominal: Data that cannot be organized into a logical order (Ex. industry classification of stocks, telecom, energy)
- Ordinal: Data that can be logically organized or ranked (Ex. ranking investment funds, 5 star to 1 star)

### Numerical

- Discrete: Data resulting from a counting process (Ex. number of children you have)
- Continuous: data that can take any numerical value within a specified range (Ex. temperature, height, weight)

### Cross sectional

Observations of one variable for different units at a given point in time (Ex. January inflation rates for different countries)

### Time series

Observations for a single unit of one variable collected over time (Ex. Daily closing prices of a particular stock)

### Panel Data

A mix of time-series and cross sectional data

Panel data consist of observations through time on one or more variables for multiple observational units. 

A two-dimensional rectangular array, or data table would be suitable for panel data because it is comprised of columns to hold the variable(s) for the observational units and rows to hold the observations through time.

Ex. data table showing EPS over time for a number of companies

### Structured

Structured data is highly organized in a predefined manner usually with repeating patterns.

Examples include:
- market data such as that issued by stock exchanges, EG, closing prices and daily volumes.
- Fundamental data such as that contained in financial statements, EG. Assets and liabilities etcetera.
- Analytical data. Which is data derived from analytics. EG, financial ratios.

### Unstructured

Unstructured data does not follow any conventionally organized form and includes data produced by individuals such as social media posts.

### Data Table

- One-Dimension array: This is time-series data and tabulating it in this way facilitates analysis, such as identifying trends
- Two-Dimension array: consists of columns and rows


## Levels of measurement

### Qualitative

Qualitative are not numbers

- Nominal: car brands, seasons (winter, spring, ...)
- Ordinal: consist of group and categories which follow a strict order. ex: rating (worse, bad, neutral, tasty, delicious)

### Quantitative

Quantitative are numbers. They are also split into two groups

- Ratio: has a true zero. Ex: number of objects, distance, time
- Interval: doesn't have a true zero. Ex: temperature
