# Population vs Sample

The first step of every statistical analysis you perform is to determine whether the data you're dealing with is a population or a sample.

## Population

A population is the collection of all items of interest to our study. 

Denoted with $N$.

The numbers we obtain when using a population are called parameters.


## Sample

A sample is a subset of the population.

Denoted with $n$.

The numbers we obtain when working with a sample are called statistics.

## Different Formulas for Population and Sample Data

In statistics, we will typically uses different formulas when working with population data and sample data.

When you have the whole population, each data point is known, you're 100% sure of the measures you're calculating.

When you take a sample of this population, it is interpreted as an approximation of the population **parameter**. Moreover, if you extract 10 different samples from the same population, you'll get 10 different measures.

Statisticians adjusted the algebraic formulas for sample and population data to reflect this issue.
