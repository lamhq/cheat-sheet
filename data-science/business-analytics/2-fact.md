# FACT framework

## Frame the question

- identify the problem that needs to be solved
- frame the problem in a way that will encourage people to use data to find the root cause and that will lead to some insight on which you can act
- frame the question in a way that can be answered using a particular analysis


## Assemble the data

- Other internally available non-financial data, as well as external data, should also be considered
- You may even want to gather your own data
- Once you identify data, you'll need to find a way to extract, to transform, and load the data, which is often referred to as the ETL process
- Do some data wrangling so that the data is structured for the calculations that you'll perform on it


## Calculate the results

- Have a good feel for the basic summary statistics of your data:
  - What is the distribution of the factors in your data?
  - How many values are missing?
  - How correlated are the factors with each other?
- Perform advanced analytics on the data by applying algorithms to provide insight by surfacing patterns in the data


## Tell others about the results

- Use technology and methods of communication that are accessible to your audience
- Make sure to observe their reaction
- Be open to receiving feedback and acknowledge the limitations of your analysis
- As you open yourself up to other opinions and perspectives, you'll most likely be able to improve your analysis and gain additional insight as a result
