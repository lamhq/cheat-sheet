# Overview of Business Analytics

In general, the way business analytics work is that it uses historical data to help us answer the following questions:

- What happened?
- Why did that happen?
- What is happening now?
- What will happen next if there's no intervention?
- What interventions should be taken to achieve the most desirable outcome?

As a business professional, it's also becoming more expected that you know how to analyze the data in a way that will bring insight to the decision context.

Hunches are not bad, and we must use data analytics to test our hunch.
