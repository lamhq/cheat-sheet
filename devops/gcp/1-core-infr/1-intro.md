# Introducing Google Cloud

## Pricing and billing

Google was the first major cloud provider to deliver **per-second billing** for its infrastructure as a service compute offering compute engine.

Compute Engine offers automatically applied sustained-use discounts which are **automatic discounts** that you get for running a virtual machine instance for a significant portion of the billing month. Specifically, when you run an instance for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically gives you a discount for every incremental minute you use for that instance.

You can define **budgets** at the billing account level or at the project level. A budget can be a fixed limit or it can be tied to another metric, for example, a percentage of the previous month spent.

To be notified when costs approach your budget limit, you can create an **alert**.

Google Cloud also implements **quotas** which are designed to prevent the over consumption of resources. There are two types of quotas, rate quotas and allocation quotas, applied at the project level. Rate quotas reset after a specific time. Allocation quotas govern the number of resources you can have in your projects.
