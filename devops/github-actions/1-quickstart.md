## Define a simple workflow

1. Create a new file `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

```yml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."

      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
      run: |
        echo "This is a multti 
        line string"
```

2. Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the `push` event and runs your workflow.

3. Go to the main page of the repository on Github, click **Actions** to view your workflow results

Getting parameters in workflow definition file:

- Event name: `${{ github.event_name }}`
- Branch name: `${{ github.ref }}`
- Repository: `${{ github.repository }}`
- Event name: `${{ github.event_name }}`
- Runner OS: `${{ runner.os }}`


## Setting up continuous integration using workflow templates

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **Actions**.
3. Find the template that matches the language and tooling you want to use, then click Set up this workflow.
4. Click Start commit.
5. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
6. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.
7. Click Propose new file.
