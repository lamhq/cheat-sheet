# Testing

**Software testing** is an essential part of software development and ensures that a product meets quality standards. Before the code reaches the customer, **testing helps detect any errors, bugs, or security issues**.

Software testing frameworks are classified into two types: **unit testing** and **integration testing**.

**Unit testing** should be done first because it is the most detailed type of testing and allows developers to identify errors within individual code components.

Then, integration testing should be performed to catch any issues that may arise when components interact with one another.
This combination of unit and integration testing contributes to the end product being bug-free and of high quality.


## Unit testing

Unit testing is a type of software testing that **looks at individual parts or units of a software system**, isolating them from other parts of the application, to make sure they work as they should.

**Unit tests** are automated and **run each time code is changed** to ensure that new code does not break existing functionality, allowing us to minimize execution time and isolate the testing use-cases from external factors.


## Integration testing

Integration Testing involves combining different parts of a software application or system, and assessing how they interact with each other.

Testing is performed on interfaces between components, as well as data exchange between components.

Integration testing should include both functional and non-functional tests, to ensure that the application meets all requirements in terms of performance, usability, security, etc.
