# Packaging & Deployment

The goal of packaging and deploying code is to ensure that applications are always secure and up to date, allowing users to access the most recent versions of an application.

## Packaging

Packaging is the process of converting installed files into a single file format that can be distributed, executed, and deployed across different systems.

Packaging also helps us keep applications current and easily accessible for rollback or subsequent deployment, saving us time spent on manual updates.


## Deployment

Deployment is the process of moving an application from its development environment to a production environment.

This includes storing the packaged file in an appropriate repository and ensuring all required components are installed correctly.

Deployment also typically includes running automated tests to ensure the code meets certain quality standards before being deployed into production.
