# Quality Check

**Quality check**, or Quality Assurance (QA) is a crucial step in the CI/CD pipeline where we can use **linting** to help us keep our code clean and error-free by spotting unused variables, unreachable parts of the code, and preventing usage of non-memory safe commands.


## Linting

**Linting** involves running automated checks on the source code of programs and calling out any potential issues or errors that could arise during runtime.

**Linting rules** are like standards for how you should write your code – making sure it’s consistent, with correct syntax and few bugs.

Linting helps us:
- Keep the code clean by spotting unused variables or unreachable parts of the code.
- Keep the code safe by preventing usage of non memory safe commands.
- Maintain the same code style through the project with the same code formatting rules.
